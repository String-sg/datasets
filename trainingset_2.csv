"Using the production possibilities curve and relevant examples, explain the concepts of scarcity, choice and opportunity cost. [10]","Production Possibility Curve (PPC) shows the maximum amount of two goods and services that can be produced by an economy at a given point in time (eg, consumer goods and capital goods as shown in Fig 1), assuming:
o resources are fully employed
o production takes place over a specific period of time
o quantity and quality of resources to produce the goods are fixed over the given period
o technology remains constant during the given period

Scarcity as illustrated on the PPC
- ability to produce only combinations of goods within or on the PPC (Points A, B or C)
- the economy achieves productive efficiency if it produces on the PPC (Points A and B) producing at the maximum output with its given resources.
- the economy’s resources are under‐utilised if it produces within the PPC (Point C) it is
possible to increase the production of capital goods with reducing the production of consumer goods.
- for every point within the PPC, there will always be another point which yields higher level of economic welfareable to produce more of one good without sacrificing the other
- by minimising the average cost of producing goods and services, the economy can maximize its output from given stock of resourcessatisfy more wants
- points beyond PPC are unattainable due to limited resources (Point D) PPC indicates the maximum quantities of the two goods that can be produced by the economy

Choice as illustrated on the PPC
 choosing to produce at two different points on the PPC (Points A or B), depending on the economy’s preference for between capital and consumer goods.
 economy will produce at Point A if it prefers more capital goods; will produce at Point B if it prefers more consumer goods
o the economy achieves allocative efficiency when it produces the right mix of goods and services so as to maximise economic welfare
Opportunity Cost as illustrated on PPC
 trade‐off between the two goods
 PPC is concave due to increasing opportunity cost because resources are not perfectly
adaptable for alternative useswhen the economy channels more resources to produce any specific good, the opportunity cost increases for each additional unit produced",,
"Discuss the view that, on balance, globalisation has benefitted Singapore. [15]","Globalisation
 the process of increasing free flow of goods and services, capital, investment, labour and ideas
Benefits of Globalisation for Singapore
 small and open economy  dependent on trade for growth  increase in demand for exports leads to a rise in AD, stimulates greater output (actual growth) and employment
 domestic firms can reap IEOS with a greater global market to serve, efficiency may also improve under greater global competition.
 lack natural resources (factor endowment)  import from countries with abundance resources (availability and lower cost of production, SRAS shifts out)
 import resources for consumptionable to consume beyond the range of goods that can be produced using domestic resources (consume beyond production possibilities to maximize social welfare)

dependent on inflow of talent, FDI and financial capital, skills and technologyable to develop knowledge intensive industries (potential comparative advantagepotential growth)
 benefit from outflow of domestic investments and outsourcing to lower cost of production
Negative Impact of Globalisation for Singapore
 high dependence on global market  extremely vulnerable to changes in global economic conditions (eg, effects of global financial crisis transmitted quickly to Singapore via large fall in export demanddrastic fall in AD, reducing domestic output and raises cyclical unemployment
 also experience capital volatility due to poor investor confidence (fall in expected net rate of return to investments)
 speeds up structural change in economy  eg, Singapore can quickly lose comparative advantage to developing countries (shift of low‐cost manufacturing through transfer of technology and information)occupational immobility of local workers can lead to rise in structural unemployment
 also increase in income disparity between skilled and unskilled workers
Possible Evaluation Points on whether Globalisation has benefitted Singapore
 depends on Singapore’s ability to retain benefits of globalization, eg, retention of profits from tangible FDI vs outflow of profits (worsening of current account in BOP)
 depends on Singapore’s ability to restructure its economy to offset the loss of comparative advantage in lower‐end industries, eg, retraining workers to reduce occupation immobility and leveling of income disparity, investment in technological advancements to develop knowledge‐ intensive industries with lesser competition",,
Explain the possible causes of high unemployment in Singapore. [10],"A high rate of unemployment can be caused by:
 Cyclical (demand‐deficit) unemployment
o Falling national incomes due to GFC  significant fall in purchasing power  sharp fall in Singapore’s export demand, assuming high YED for Singapore’s exports
o Large share of X in AD  fall in X leads to decrease in AD  firms face large unplanned investments, thus reducing output and demand for factors of production (including labour). Fall in NY and employment reinforced by multiplier process, leading to increase in cyclical unemployment.
 Structural unemployment
o Structural change in economy (eg, loss of export demand coupled with loss of
comparative advantage causing sharp decline in manufacturing sector, strong growth in services sector due to opening of IRs)laid‐off workers unable to find alternative employment (eg, due to factor immobility)high structural unemployment
 Real‐wage unemployment
o
Wages may be held above market clearing level and unable to adjust quickly (eg, contractual agreement)use DD/SS analysis to show surplus labourhigh real‐wage unemployment",,

o SPUR (Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience) – training opportunities for workers who are unemployed in view of skills mismatch with the employment opportunities available. The training serves to reduce domestic structural unemployment in the long run.
 Limitations – Need to convince employers and workers to invest time and effort for a long term benefit when they are facing short term constraints.
o Increase in government expenditure as a form of expansionary fiscal policies (eg, bring forward infrastructural projects, increase provisions in education and healthcare, expand employment in public sector).

 Analyse how changes in income will affect the various goods imported from EU;
 Compared to domestic good, imported goods like EU cars, wines and fashion wears etc, should have an YED>1 (luxury), thus dd will increase for imported goods as income increased;
 Taste and preferences should also shift towards imported goods as compared to domestic goods;
 Thus DD for import will shift to the right while DD for the domestic goods should shift to the left cp;
Identify the supply factors: reducing tariff (cost of import)
 Reducing tariff will lower the cost of imported goods => SS curve will shift to the right;
 Thus, PED is important in determining the impacts on import expenditure;
 For most imported consumers durables, PED should be > 1 as imported goods are
viewed as more luxurious and proportion of income spend is relatively higher;
 Given a fall in price, import expenditure should increase;
 On the other hand, demand for domestic goods will fall as imported goods are substitutes for the domestic goods, example imported cars and domestic produced cars; the extend of the fall in domestic demand depends on the degree of substitutability between the imports and domestic goods;

 SS ↑ as tariff ↓ (Pm ↓) XED between local and imports
 PED > 1, PES > 1 (manufacturing products)
 Sales should fall

"Proton, Malaysia’s largest car producer, continues to struggle with high production costs that make local cars relatively more expensive than many foreign cars.
Source: AsiaTimes Aug 2003
(a) Explain how a firm like Proton can enjoy economies of scale. [10]","INTRODUCTION
Identify that Proton is a large producer in an oligopoly car market → it is able to enjoy internal and external economies of scale.
BODY
Explain: When a firm wants to increase its size to produce more output or enlarges its scale of production, it can enjoy cost savings.
Define internal economies of scale: possible cost reductions that a firm enjoys when it increases in size. This is reflected by a fall in average costs illustrated by a movement along the LRAC curve as the size of firm increases.
Sources of Internal Economies of Scale Technical economies
Division of labour and specialisation
- When output is sufficiently large, it becomes more efficient to allow workers to specialise in their tasks as it saves time to repeat the same task rather than move from one task to another. Thus more output can be assembled by the firm's workers in a given time because of the increase in workers' productivity. Division of labour thus increases the productivity of labour, resulting in lower unit cost of production.
Indivisibility of plant
- Some inputs may be too large for a small firm to use efficiently. A large firm that requires the use of indivisible inputs will reduce its average costs when output increases.
- Eg. Protons are manufactured in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Tanjung Malim. Capable of 150,000 units per annum on four multi-model production lines, it allows flexibility and rapid response to market demand situations. Thus it requires a large firm to use the indivisible inputs effectively to reduce average costs.
Commercial economies
- As the firm expands, marketing economies can be reaped when it buys inputs and sells its output. It can buy inputs such as raw materials in bulk, thereby enjoying lower prices. In addition, it may also receive discounts as suppliers are usually keen to maintain business relations with larger firms.

Marketing economies
- A larger firm can spread its advertisement and promotion costs over a larger output, thereby reducing the unit cost of production. For Proton to be able to fully exploit EOS, it is necessary for Proton to expand overseas by engage in marketing activities such as new launches in emerging car markets e.g. China, South Africa, etc, to build brand awareness and see whether there is any significant increase in exports.
Financial economies
- Financial economies arise as large firms can borrow money more cheaply than small firms. Banks are more likely to charge larger firms lower interest rates as they are usually deemed to be more credit-worthy i.e. they are seen as customers who are better able to repay loans.
Managerial economies
- As a firm expands, it is also able to hire professionals to specialise in different areas of work. Different departments can be set up, each led by an expert in the field. This specialisation increases the productivity of the firm and thus lowers unit cost of production.
External Economies of scale: cost advantages that accrue to all firms in a particular industry due to the growth of the industry itself or improvement in the level of production technology.
Average Costs ($)
C1 C2
This is more evident if car industry is supported by government to make it viable. Lowering of average cost can be reaped in the following types of external economies of scale:
Sources of External Economies of Scale
Economies of Concentration
If firms in an industry cluster in the same area, they can reap the economies of concentration.
The individual firm benefits:
- if the industry’s suppliers also re-locate their operations in the vicinity. Apart
from ready access to inputs such as raw materials, the cost of these inputs also falls with lower transportation fees.
- E.g. Managing Director of Goodyear pointed out that it is important to make high quality of goods easily available for consumers to buy. Hence, Goodyear shifted its manufacturing base to Thailand in anticipation of growing demand.
- as labour with specific skills and talents are attracted to where the industry is concentrated. This translates to lower hiring costs for all firms as they do not have to advertise as widely or in as many newspapers as before.
- from the growth of supporting facilities, subsidiary industries and setting up of research and development centres. Technological improvements translate into lower unit costs of production. E.g. Goodyear had hosted engineers from Proton at their technical centre to improve on their quality of products to reduce cost of production.
- as the government becomes interested in developing the local infrastructure to provide better access to the airports and seaports, thereby reducing transportation and other costs.
Economies of Information
- As an industry grows there is generally an associated growth in the number of trade or specialist journals catering to the needs of the industry. Information about the industry becomes more widely available from which all firms in the industry can benefit. There may even be televised features about the industry which provide free publicity. This reduces the costs of generating information for the firm.",,
Discuss the relevance of achieving cost savings in determining the welfare of consumers. [15],"INTRODUCTION
 State that the welfare of consumers is the individual benefits derived from the consumption of goods and services and it is affected by price changes.
 Hence, changes in prices will be result a change in consumer surplus (measure of aggregate consumer welfare)
 Define consumers’ surplus: excess of social valuation of product over price actually paid. It is measured by the area of a triangle below a demand curve and above the observed price.

Thesis:
Students need to identify the causes of cost savings and the underlying assumptions.
Supply factors:
(i) Economies of scale (no need to elaborate too much here as it has been
explained in part (a))
 Economies of scale (Internal or external EOS)→ ↓AC
 Assume that the producers pass on the costs to consumers, ↓Prices→↑
Consumers surplus.
(ii) Subsidies
 Aim of subsidy (A form of protectionist measure to protect the infant industry): Lower prices of the domestic cars (Proton) to stimulate the consumption of Proton since it is the national car brand.
Students need to explain the increase in consumer surplus using DD and SS analysis. The effect of a subsidy on the supply of a good → ss shifts right → the equilibrium price and quantity               P, Q
 It will benefit the consumers (for those who buy Proton cars) if the producers are willing to pass on the cost savings to the consumers.
Evaluation
However, if the cost-savings lead to compromise of the product quality, there will be a general fall in consumer welfare.
Better answer will bring in the extent of shift of SS curve which will affect the extent of consumer surplus.

Anti-thesis
1. Firms may not pass on the cost savings to consumers due to high BTE.
Proton has a large market share (Oligopoly market) → price is rigid in the short run → even if there is a fall in cost of production → Proton is not able to reduce prices in fear of price war.
2. Government intervention: Impose tariffs or quotas on imported cars
Aim of a tariff/ quotas: increase the price paid for the imported cars by domestic customers, while leaving the prices paid to foreign producers the same.
Students need to consider the effects of a specific tariff and quotas on imported cars in Malaysia and explain how it results in a loss of consumer surplus and a fall in choices due to the higher-priced cars.
Analysis:
When Malaysia implements a tariff/quota → fall in SS of imported cars  ↑ in equilibrium price & ↓ in equilibrium quantity (diagram + explanation)
Evaluate:
By imposing tariffs/quotas: violate ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (the agreement effectively bar practices that discriminate against goods that are considered “Made in ASEAN” by the use of tariff and/or non-tariff barriers). Malaysia government has to pay penalties to ASEAN members for violating established free-trade regulations.
Tariff/quota effects on the Malaysia’s consumers
Consumers of the imported cars in the Malaysia suffer a reduction in well-being as a result of the tariff/ quotas. The increase in the domestic price of imported cars reduces the amount of consumer surplus and thus variety of cars available to the consumers in the market.
Consumers of Proton in Malaysia enjoy an improvement in well-being as it seems that the price of Proton has become relative cheaper compared to imported cars.
Alternative answers
Assess the effect of the government measure to liberalise domestic car market
Aim of liberalising the domestic car market: to promote sustained economic growth and increase in standard of living for its people.
Analysis:
When Malaysia liberalise domestic car market by reducing tariff/quotas → increase in SS of imported cars  ↓ in equilibrium price & ↑ in equilibrium quantity (diagram + explanation)
E.g. Malaysia’s car market set to accelerate after the government slashed import duties on imported cars made in ASEAN countries, in line with the regional trade development.

Removal of tariff/ quotas effects on the Malaysia’s consumers
Consumers of the imported cars in the Malaysia enjoy an improvement in well-being as a result of a removal of tariff/ quotas. The decrease in the domestic prices and increase in the quantity of imported cars increases the amount of consumer surplus in the market.
Since Proton cars are substitutes of imported cars, competition can cause the demand for Proton cars to fall. This will lead to a fall in the price of Proton cars. Therefore, the overall impact would be a fall in the price of cars and increase in the quantity of cars demanded, consumer surplus will increase leading to an increase in the welfare of the consumers.
Evaluation:
Malaysia may reduce tariff/ quotas on ASEAN made cars. However, they may still retain high import duties on non-ASEAN made vehicles.
3. Improvement in technology
Students need to note that R & D is critical for car industry.
High BTE→ Car industry will be able to earn supernormal profits in the long run. → to strengthen BTE→ Engage in R&D → improve in quality of cars → increase in consumer welfare
Evaluation:
Proton is already suffering from high cost of production. Hence, they may not have the excess supernormal profits to engage in R&D. For R&D to take place, the company has to invest in people, productivity and technology which may be difficult as it takes time and lots of resources. Within a ‘cutthroat environment’, it may be hard for Proton to move forward unless they have some technological tie-up with a foreign partner.
Overall evaluation
The effects on consumer surplus in long and short run
 SR: Consumer welfare will improve especially in Malaysia as majority of the car
owners consume Protons rather than imported cars. However, consumers of imported car will suffer as they have to pay a higher price for the same specification.
 LR: The uncompetitiveness of Malaysian firms and the failure of Malaysian industry to move up the value chain in the face of increasing costs and competition from other countries in the region. Furthermore, the lack of R&D, still cloud the horizon Malaysia’s long term prospects are therefore somewhat uncertain. This will affect the consumer welfare in the long run as they are consuming goods of a lower quality.
 The extent of relevance: It is not necessary true that cost savings will really affect the welfare of consumers in Malaysia. Given that Proton is protected by the government, cost savings may not be a big issue as government will find ways and means to reduce the price of Protons to encourage consumption.",,
"The wonders of free market often disappear when the assumptions are relaxed.
(a) Explain how the free market could bring ‘wonders’ to the economy. [10]","Analysis of Question
- Explain: no evaluation required though high order analysis is expected.
- Free market: Market without govt intervention/regulation
- ‘Wonders’: to be interpreted as the benefits/advantages
- Answer should present a hypothetical case of how the unregulated market could
perform its two functions well (achieving allocative efficiency), while explaining the conditions/assumptions within which the ‘wonders’ could be reaped.
INTRODUCTION
- The study of economics revolves around making the best of the limited resources we have. One of the methods in utilising the resources would be to leave it to the free, unregulated market system to allocate the resources to production of goods and then to allocate those produced goods to maximise social welfare. Though often touted as the ideal method, some assumptions need to be made in order for the wonders to be materialised.
BODY
- The free market performs two important roles – allocate scarce/limited resources to production of goods and services demanded by consumers; and to allocate such goods and services to consumers. The reason why it remains efficient is that it relies on the price mechanism to do so.
- Wonder 1 – Efficient allocation of resources
Producers in the free market will find incentive (in the form of profits) to respond to consumers’ demand for goods and services. Thus, consumer sovereignty will govern how scarce resources in an economy get allocated to the production of a myriad of goods and services. The increase in demand for a good will lead to upward bidding of prices for that good, signalling to produces to marshal more resources to produce that good. Eventually, the market will restore equilibrium, a situation with no shortage nor surplus – the wonderful outcome of resource allocation as there was no wastage of scarce resources and no one who is willing to pay for the good gets denied of the good.
- Wonder 2 – Efficient allocation of goods among consumers
Once the goods get produced, the market again does its job of allocating them to the consumers. Only those consumers who are willing and able to pay for the good gets it. There is no other mechanism necessary for the market to work its wonders to perform such allocation. It also ensures that no one who is unwilling or unable to pay for the good gets it.

- Some assumptions/conditions
There are at least three assumptions which is required for the free market to achieve AE.
(i) Perfect Information
Both consumers and producers need to know the changes in the market signal (i.e. price) so as to respond to it. Suppose demand has fallen, but the producers were not aware of the change in taste and preference of their customers. The continued production of the good will thus represent wastage of resources in the production of goods. The amount of wastage will correspond to the amount of time taken for the information (fall in demand) to be transmitted to the producers, who will then cut down production, thereby using less resources. In reality, such time lag could be substantial.
(ii) Perfect Factor Mobility
Even when the producers know that there has been an increase in demand, producers may find it difficult to increase their output immediately due to resource constraint. For example, it is difficult to find more lawyers to handle increase in lawsuit cases, discover new pieces of rich farm land to boost agricultural production, and manufacture another specialised machinery to produce cars in face of increase in demand for a certain product in a short period of time. Hence, there will remain shortages in the market – allocative inefficiency occurs.
(iii) Absence of Market Failure
Based on self-interest, whereby individuals seek to maximise their own personal welfare, the market fails to take into consideration the welfare the society should garner. Externalities, under-consumption of merit and over-consumption of demerit goods as well as the absence of incentive to produce public good will mean that the allocation of resources was not ideally done by the free market itself. There might be over- and under- allocation of resources, leading to an outcome that was not entirely wonderful.
CONCLUSION
Free market can indeed bring wonders to the economy in terms of resource and goods allocation. However, that would only be restricted to those products which do not face the constraints as described above. Otherwise, the free market may also fail to do its wonders for the economy.",,
(b) Discuss the view that the government would often fare better than the free market when the assumptions are relaxed. [15],"Analysis of Question

- A classic question on market failure vs. govt failure. Answer needs to present at least two cases of market failure and how the govt could ‘fare’ better than when left to the free market. Must prove that the DWL is lowered with govt intervention.
INTRODUCTION
- When the market fails to bring wonder to the economy, the government often has to step in to attempt to maximise society’s welfare. However, it is not always the case that the government may fare better than the market all the time. The outcome would depend mostly on the capability of the government in recognising and resolving the problem left by the free market.
BODY
- Market Failure – Steel Production (-ve ext)
In the event of a negative externalities suffered by a laundry shop next to a steel factory, the steel producing market has failed to achieve allocative efficiency as excessive production has caused society’s welfare to be suboptimal. Should the social cost be taken into account by the steel producer, there will be less output produced, hence, reducing the net welfare cost incurred due to the excess production.
Government’s response
The government could then impose a quota of the amount of steel the producer can churn out per period. This will move the production closer to the social optimal level. The ability to achieve such socially optimum level of output requires the government to be able to accurately project/predict that level of output. Data on cost and benefits to all parties (and not just the laundry shop boss) need to be collected. This is a difficult task considering the scale of operation of a steel factory and the impact pollution might have on people in the long run might lead to several factors instead of merely inhalation of excessive pollution from a particular steel factory! Hence, with inappropriate data or methodology employed, the government might not be able to fare any better than the free market (in the event that too few amount of steel was produced, leading to huge shortage in the construction sector?).
- Market Failure – Public Good
The economy cannot depend on the free market to provide public good. There is simply no incentive for any profit-motivated firm to do so, as he cannot possible collect any revenue from the ‘sale’ of public good. Hence, the government’s role here is to provide the public good free. Such provision will therefore have to be funded by tax revenue collected.
Government’s response
It is indeed true that the government is likely to fare better than the free market – at least some public goods get produced! Such desirable goods/services such as streetlamps, parks, defence would otherwise be left out of the free market’s consideration. Indeed, the government has helped to improve the allocation of scarce resources to the production and provision of such goods to the economy, thereby improving the society’s welfare.

Evaluation:
Not all governments can fare better than the free market all the time. For example, if the government does not have the technical know-how to improve the market performance, then, the outcome would unlikely be a better one. A government dealing with its first ever local crude oil exploration firm may not have had the experience to limit the amount of pollution it can generate.
Even if the government possesses the technical knowledge, the changing economic climate and advancement in technology employed by the firm may render the policy (e.g. quota) previously set by the government outdated. This is likely going to lead to an under-provision of the goods in the market, depriving the society the positive net welfare of consuming the good.
CONCLUSION
It is difficult for an economist to assess whether the government has done better or fared worse than the free market in allocation of resources. This is because there are often multiple viewpoints and beliefs placed by various stakeholders. The continued monitoring of the key market indicators would inform the government of the appropriate actions that need to be taken in order to sustain a high standard of living for everybody in Singapore and beyond.",,
" The relative importance of aggregate expenditure components in influencing the outcome of the economy differ among economies, depending on their size, openness and the government policies.
(a) Explain the above statement. [10]","Question Analysis
The focus of this part of the question is on how different components of aggregate expenditure ( C, G, I and X-M) can be relatively more or less important depending on the kind of economy and its governance. The importance is here linked to the outcome of the economy which comprises its economic performance in terms of macroeconomic objectives such as low inflation rate, low unemployment rate, sustained and stable economic growth, favourable BOP position and strong and stable exchange rate.
INTRODUCTION
 Define and explain Aggregate Expenditure (AE)
 A good knowledge and understanding of AE enable us to judge/analyse the outcome
of the economy.
Note: the framework used is Y=AE approach to determining the level of income and
employment (outcome of economy)
BODY
So what is meant by AE?
AE is the sum of desired consumption, investment, government expenditure and net export expenditures. It has 2 components: an autonomous component and an induced component.
Consumption: C = a + bY where b is the mpc and a is the autonomous consumption.
Investment, Government expenditure and Export earnings assumed to be constant, exogenously determined, an autonomous component of aggregate expenditure. Imports assumed to be endogenously determined (i.e. income-induced)
 Explain what is meant by the outcome of an economy
All economies desire the attainment of goals such as low inflation rate, low unemployment rate, sustained and stable economic growth, favourable BOP position and strong and stable exchange rate. However it is not always possible to achieve all these macroeconomic objectives simultaneously. Inevitably there would usually be a trade-off among these goals often guided by what a government judges to be the most pressing problem at hand that needs immediate attention and cure.

 Link the relative importance of AE components with size, openness of economy as well as government policies
Changes in AE depending on which components change and their relative importance have differing effects on the outcome of the economy. Of course, no one economy is exactly the same as another, so each though dependent on AE changes to influence the economy, the components of AE which are more dominant therefore differ depending on the characteristics of the economy.
Size of the economy does exert a powerful influence on which component is likely to be relatively more dominant. For example, the U.S., a large economy, tend to depend more on domestic consumption expenditure than other components to alter AE be it to boost AE in times of recession or to reduce AE when inflation specifically demand- pull inflation gets out of hand. Although it is easy to conclude a large economy is likely to depend more on domestic consumption, this might turn out not accurate in certain cases.
Let’s consider China. It is a large economy which with its rapidly increasing affluence as well as population which still relies more on exports earnings rather than domestic consumption despite strong economic growth in the past decade. This phenomenon is in part due to Chinese government policies such as undervaluation of Yuan which are aimed to increase export earnings and decrease import expenditure. Also a large part of production are aimed in capital goods rather than final consumer goods to spur future growth, which could also explain relatively less importance to domestic consumption in influencing AE.
Openness of the economy plays a part in determining which component/s of AE will be relatively more important. Very open economies such as Singapore are more dependent on external trade than less open economies such as US in influencing AE. Of course, size of Singapore in a way does force it to be very open since it is a small nation with limited natural resources, thus making it both export and import reliant for both survival and growth. So does government policies of Singapore which saw export-led and FDI driven growth by ensuring brand name for Singapore’s products internationally and conducive pro-business environment in the island state.
Explain the relative importance of AE components to the outcome of the economy.
As established so far, the size and openness of economy and government policies impact the relative importance of AE components and thus the effect on the outcome of the economy.
In 2008, the global financial crisis had a major impact albeit a negative one on most economies of the world. In US, the major contributor to falling AE was domestic consumption due to uncertainty and poor consumer sentiment. Falling AE due to falling C had widened the deflationary gap and possibly brought multiplied fall in equilibrium RNY assuming there was a fall in autonomous C as well. Since, US is less open and given its relatively low saving and tax rates, this fall in real output is likely to be large given its relatively larger multiplier size and huge impact of fall in C on AE. This does explain how US suffered from recession and high unemployment rate in 2008 and 2009.

In Singapore’s case, the drastic fall in export earnings from other countries such as US and Europe rather than fall in domestic consumption that had a relatively stronger impact on AE as it led to a huge fall in AE, triggering a deflationary gap in Singapore. Given the relatively smaller multiplier due to its great openness in terms of great propensity to import as well as high savings rate, the fall in equilibrium RNY is likely to be at a smaller extent compared to a country like US but still Singapore did suffer from recession and rising unemployment in 2009 but bounced back as other economies recovered combined with timely and effective government policies such as Resilience Package.
CONCLUSION
The outcome of an economy is affected as explained above by changes to AE. However not all changes in AE components have similar effects on outcome. In countries like the U.S., a relative change in C has stronger influence on its economy than a country like Singapore which is more dependent on external trade. The relative importance of AE components in turn depend on the characteristics of an economy such as its size, openness and government policies.",,

Focus: Consider alternative policies, both demand and supply-sides, to achieve the objective of sustainable growth for the economy. Students have to explain how the suggested policies can achieve the stated objectives and assess the ability to sustain its growth which can be both short and long term. The assessment has to be linked to the characteristics of Singapore economy and the constraints she faces in the world of globalisation. Analysis can be based on AD/AS or Y=AE framework.
INTRODUCTION
 Introduce Singapore as a small, open and with few natural resources.
 Explain economic growth – actual and potential, measured by increase in real GDP
 AD/AS framework
o With the help of a diagram, explain how the initial equilibrium National Income (where AD=AS ) can be increased given an increase in any of the components AD or AS.
BODY
 Policies that can change AD or AS  FP (G), MP (I), exchange rate policy (X-M), supply- side (AS), trade (X-M).
 Students are to choose 3 to explain, elaborate (with specific examples) and assess: 1 demand, 1 supply and exchange rate/trade. Assess each of them in terms of their effectiveness/limitations, appropriateness. However, ‘sustainability’ is key in this answer.
 Thus sustainability would encourage increase in the components of AD in the SR (which component would be determined by the size, openness etc as discussed in part (a)), and increase in AS in the LR (increase in terms of increase in quantitative and qualitative capacity of FOP for potential growth)
 Analysis can follow the following points of discussion:
o Given a rise in AD (as it approaches to Full N), sustainability has to be discussed
in terms of increasing potential growth by increasing AS (i.e. supply side policy in the long run)
o Being vulnerable to the external forces, in the case of stagnant growth (when brought about by increasing cost of production – in the case of stagflation), the policies that are appropriate have to affect the (X-M), I components of AD and the AS.
Possible Overall Evaluation:
Among the 3 policies that were assessed, compare the appropriateness their and the challenges faced by a small and open economy like Singapore (with no natural resources) as compared other economies with different characteristics, e.g. USA, China and emerging economies.
Conclusion:
Given the vulnerability of Singapore position and our reliance on international trade, policies that would help cushion negative external impact on the economy have to take priority.",,

INTRODUCTION
- There are macroeconomic objectives of a government and the attainment of all of them would likely bring improvement in the standard of living (SOL) of its people. Low unemployment is one of these aims. Though achieving low unemployment is likely to bring improvement in SOL, it may not always do so.
BODY
- Low unemployment rate refers to a situation where a small percentage of the workforce is willing and able to work but could not get a job. Joblessness brings opportunity costs to the economy in terms of the income and output which could have been otherwise produced and consumed. The lower the rate, the lower the opportunity cost.
- Real GDP per capita could help indicate the material aspect of one’s average quality of life in a country. The higher the figure, the more goods and services the average person can enjoy. Non-material aspect of SOL, however, would require another set of indicators such as level of pollution, accessibility of medical services, work stress level, income distribution, etc.
- There are a few ways in which the govt could achieve low unemployment rate in an economy. Depending on the source of the unemployment, there needs to be the appropriate strategies to resolve the various types of unemployment. One key strategy would be to adopt the expansionary fiscal/monetary policy to combat cyclical or demand-deficient unemployment. When faced with structural unemployment, the govt could adopt supply-side policies to ensure that workers are re-trained and re- equipped with the right knowledge and skills for the job available in the economy.
- Low unemployment rate would indicate that a large portion of the workforce will be able to earn an income. As a whole, the real GDP per capita will remain high (assuming constant population and price levels), indicating that the economy is currently producing near its full potential output. With the high income per capita, households can enjoy high material standard of living by being able to satisfy a broad range of wants and needs.
- Will maintaining low unNt rate improve the SOL?
o Yes,itwill.
Low unNt rate indicates that high amount of income earned. This also means that a high level of savings can be expected. Should such savings be channelled to fund investment projects, the economy can expect to reap potential economic growth in the future. Assuming such investments bear fruits, the actual growth brought forth by the potential growth will mean even higher NY earned. Hence, material aspect of SOL would increase, indicating an improvement in the SOL.
Low unNt rate also means that govt will need to spend less on subsidies or unemployment benefits. Such freeing up of precious budget funds could be channelled to other more productive uses such as to raise the productivity of the workforce to secure higher paying jobs for the average worker in the long run. Alternatively, the lower budget outlay required could lead to the govt lowering the tax rates (direct as well as indirect). Such a move is likely to bring forth even greater consumption and investment, both of which will boost the economy, generating higher income for all. Material aspect of SOL will tend to increase in tandem.


o No,itwill not.
The potential growth described above may not be accompanied by actual growth should the economy face a recession in the future. No increase in output was experienced and there will be as much income per capita as there had been before. Material aspect of SOL remains unchanged.
Even if there will be increase in actual output, such increase in output will usually be at the cost of the environment. More factories need to be powered and more resources required in the production line would mean that air/noise/water pollution will be generated. Quality of life could hardly be considered to have improved should workforce apply for more sick leave and had to don face mask whenever one ventures outdoor.
The increase in income generated may not be equitably distributed in the absence of a sound income tax regime. Any of such increase in national income could largely fall into the hands of the few influential firms/industries, leading to the rich gaining the most during such growth periods. In this case, the average worker may not experience any improvement in their SOL.
The increase in income may have led the average individual to experience an increase in ability to consume more goods and services. Depending his choice of consumption pattern, one may observe that his SOL may not have improved. Should he choose to gamble, drink or consume unhealthy food, it would be hard pressed to consider his SOL to have improved.
If the attainment of low unNt comes at the expense of high inflation, the economy will also suffer from lower purchasing power, possible loss in FDI as well as export revenue. Should this continue, the economic outlook will unlikely be favourable and improvement in SOL would be difficult to reap.
EVALUATION
- How was the low unNt rate achieved?
If it was the huge amount of G that propped up the economy through expansionary FP, the high tax burden in the future may negate any likely increase in gross income, leaving the same disposable income fairly unchanged.
- The types of unemployment?
Overall low unNt rate in an economy could be achieved when the extremely low unNt rate in one sector is negated by a rather significant unNt rate in another sector. The prolonged unNt rate in the declining industry will require substantial re-training/re- skilling of workers before they become a huge drag on the economy.
CONCLUSION
While low unNt is a valid economic objective to attain, it may not necessarily bring higher SOL in the future. The govt should keep a tab on the composition of unNt rate as well as other indicators so as to implement appropriate remedial actions to maximise the potential of such improvement in SOL in the future.",,
"Globalisation is a double-edged sword, as the increased interconnectedness not only creates opportunities but also presents risks.
Speech by Mrs. Lim Hwee Hua, Minister Of State For Finance And Transport At The CPA Forum, Aug 2007
(a) Explain how globalisation could bring opportunities and risks to an economy. [12]","Students are expected to explain both the opportunities and risks on both the micro & macro goals of an economy (preferably Singapore).
INTRODUCTION
- Define globalisation
 Globalisation refers to the integration of the world’s economy into a single international market in term of trade in goods and services, technology, labour and capital flows.
- Main forces driving globalisation:
 Rapid advancement of technology, lowering of trade barriers, etc.
- With globalisation, it means freer flow of goods and services (free trade), capital across borders and labour.
- Briefly mention some characteristics of Singapore
 Limited natural resources and dependent on trade and investment for economic growth due to small domestic sector.
BODY Opportunities
- Increase consumer welfare as consumers can obtain lower priced goods because
Singapore’s trading partners could produce them more efficiently due to their comparative advantage (more cost efficient). Singapore, being a small nation with little natural resources, has the most to gain from free trade. Globalisation enables its citizens to have access to products that Singapore does not produce and thus enjoy greater varieties & choice of goods and services. Therefore, it will lead to an improvement in the material aspect of SOL of the citizens.
- Along with trade creations, more foreign investment (long term capital inflow) inflows (from US and China etc) can possibility creating an improvement or even surplus in BOP position together with the increased in export demand. In addition, as Singapore has already minimal tariffs before FTA, the increase in imports from tariff reduction would be small. With a potential BOP surplus, it is likely that exchange rates will appreciate which enable Singapore to achieve external stability.
- Increase in AD through increase in consumption, investment, net exports implies an increase in production through the multiplier process which will lead to an increase in NY, employment and SR economic growth (if economy is operating below full employment). Show AD-AS curve. Creation of jobs in X sector due to higher demand for domestically produced goods due to CA.


- Sustained economic growth can be achieved through technology transfer to Singapore from foreign investments as well as increase in capital accumulation which allows Singapore to increase productivity, increasing the productive capacity of the economy and hence achieving LR economic growth. Show rightward shift of AS curve.
- Increase domestic firms’ efficiency in production and quality of products because of greater competition from foreign firms. Domestic firms will try to achieve productive efficiency (PE) and dynamic efficiency (DE) to remain competitive in the global market. Elaborate on PE and DE.
- Domestic producers will gain from an enlarged export market, particularly for small domestic market like Singapore as they are able to reap internal EOS due to larger scale of production. In addition, with greater opportunities to outsource in order to reduce costs due to cheaper labour costs overseas e.g. China and India, which also increases the profitability of firms.
Risks
- Increase unemployment in Singapore
1) Structural unemployment especially in industries such as manufacturing due to greater competition from lower-cost foreign producers or transition of economy from capital intensive to knowledge & technology based industries. Decline in production levels will imply hiring of lesser labour or even retrenchment of workers. As such, workers who are previously employed in the sunset industries (or industries without CA) cannot gain employment in sunrise industries because of the mismatch of skills of these workers with the jobs available.
2) Cyclical unemployment can occur due to overreliance on exports which might make Singapore more vulnerable to external shocks. E.g. Fall in GDP due to
SARS outbreak, global recession etc  fall in demand for labour  unemployment rises.
- Increasing trade and capital flows encourage advancement in technology and increasing productivity of factors of production. Thus, less workers may be required due to the increase in technology and productivity levels and the economy may be facing jobless growth.
- With an increase in AD due to increase in net X and I, it may lead to dd pull inflation if Singapore’s operating close to Yf. Goods and services in Singapore will become more expensive and consumers’ ability to buy more goods and services will fall and hence leading to lower material SOL.
- On the other hand, slower economic growth may occur because of greater competition from emerging economies such as China & Indiafall or slower increase in investment, fall or slower increase in AD  multiplied fall or slower increase in NY, output & increased cyclical UN  lowers material SOL of Singaporeans. Singapore would also be faced with the need to develop new areas of comparative advantage and move up the value-added industries.
- Increase in NY through improved X revenue could lead to more M expenditure and worsens CA balance if the increase in M expenditure is greater than increase in X revenue. Given that the MPM in Singapore is very high, it increases the likelihood of worsening CA as there is a need for Singapore to import more resources for the production of more exports. Higher reliance on M may also make us more vulnerable to the threat of imported inflation.

 Coupled with the possibility of outward FDI, i.e. FDI may relocate to cheaper destinations which may result in ‘hollowing out’ of domestic economy, thereby worsening Singapore’s BOP position.
- Higher income disparities may be observed as workers in exporting industries are likely to see higher incomes while those that focus in producing for domestic sectors are likely to see their incomes falling. The influx of cheap unskilled labour from the neighbouring countries such as India and Thailand has driven down the wages of unskilled workers in Singapore. On the other hand, highly skilled labour is demanded by MNCs in other countries and thus these workers are able to earn high wages abroad.
- Lower SOL (non-material aspect) due to higher stress level and greater environmental problems. Workers may need to work longer hours at the expense of leisure time. Environmental problems such as air pollution, water pollution etc due to higher levels of industrial production, clearing of land for production facilities, discharge of toxic wastes into the environment may occur.
- Possible occurrence of brain drain – loss of scarce talent to other countries which is a major challenge confronting the small open economy. It is a serious concern as this will limit the growth of the economy. Fall in productive capacity of Singapore economyAS fallslimit both actual & potential growth of the economy. Despite Singapore’s development of a world class education system to produce a skilled workforce, brain drain implies that the benefits will not be experienced by the Singapore economy despite efforts by government in incurring huge costs to provide subsidised education to its citizens.
CONCLUSION
- Governments, in this case, should strive to maximise benefits (opportunities) and minimise costs (risks) through attempts to foster greater economic integration and government policies are needed to address problems so as to fully benefit from globalisation.",,
"(b) Discuss whether the Singapore government currently adopts appropriate policies to
reduce the risks of globalisation. [13]","Question Analysis
Students are expected to identify two most harmful risks of globalisation with reference to part (a) and provide a clear, detailed explanation and analysis of how the various current policies adopted by the Singapore government work to mitigate them, addressing the appropriateness of the policies by looking at their strengths and limitations.
INTRODUCTION
As explained in part (a), globalisation brings about various opportunities and risks to the Singapore economy. However, due to the unique characteristics of the Singapore economy, it is impossible for Singapore to resist the trend towards globalisation. Thus, the Singapore government has embraced globalisation and undertook various measures to reduce the harmful risks on the economy.
BODY
Two most harmful risks (not exhaustive):
(i) Loss of comparative advantage (in the production of certain goods such as low value manufactured products) leading to outflow of investments and thus a rise in structural unemployment;
(ii) Over-reliance on external demand and thus increased vulnerability to external shocks on the economy.
Note: If students select other risks, tutors are to award mark based on their explanation and analysis accordingly.
In view of these harmful risks, the government has undertaken some measures to reduce the extent of their impact.
For the 1st harmful risk:
Loss of comparative advantage  implies a loss of export competitiveness in the production of certain exports. For e.g., Singapore may become relatively more expensive for firms to invest in the production of low-value products which usually are more labour-intensive thus leading to outflow of FDI.
In view of the above, Singapore government attempted to develop new areas of comparative advantage by encouraging new clusters of growth i.e. moving up the value chain from production of low-value products to more knowledge intensive sectors such as environmental and water technology, biomedical sciences etc. For e.g. provide R&D incentives and grants to improve quality of exports and efforts to promote new capabilities in these areas.
In addition, besides providing quality infrastructure such as transport and communication networks, the government will also try to attract foreign investments through the attractive corporate tax regime by ensuring competitive corporate tax rate. In doing so, this will enable Singapore to attract new firms, especially those more knowledge and technology intensive. Moreover, the outflow of FDI due to the loss of comparative advantage could give rise to structural unemployment as low skilled workers find their jobs lost to countries like China and India where labour is relatively cheaper. These workers are unable to take on jobs in the new industries in the short run.
Thus, Singapore government has adopted supply side policies to improve the skills of such low-skilled workers through retraining and increasing the productivity level of its labour force. For e.g. WTS (Workfare Training Scheme) aims to equip workers with skills to stay employable in the new industries. In doing so, the productive capacity of the economy will also increase leading to long term potential growth.

Evaluation
Training involves huge cost and results often are not guaranteed. Moreover, providing R&D grants are costly and there are opportunity costs incurred as these grants could be used to provide subsidies in other areas such as healthcare and education etc.
For the 2nd harmful risk:
Over-reliance on external demandincreased vulnerability to external shocks. For e.g., recent financial crisis spread and led to a recession in Singapore due to a fall in demand for Singapore exports by our trading partners such as US. This translated into a rise in cyclical unemployment due to the fall in AD and thus national income.
In view of the above, Singapore government tried to mitigate the extent of the fall in AD and national income by adopting expansionary fiscal policy. This was done through increasing G by hiring more people in the public sector as well as increasing its expenditure on improving the infrastructure of the country by building more MRT lines such as the Circle and Downtown lines, etc. This will raise national income through increasing AD and thus mitigate the extent of cyclical unemployment.
Evaluation
Small multiplier in Singapore implies that any attempt to pump money into the economy is likely to leak out as imports and this is unlikely to be substantial to increase the national income significantly. Moreover, with the poor economic outlook and small domestic market, it is unlikely that any increase in domestic consumption, investment and government expenditure would be sufficient to raise national income and employment as the growth of the economy is mainly export-driven.
CONCLUSION
Conclude that on the whole, current policies are largely appropriate despite their limitations. These measures are adopted after taking into account the fact that Singapore cannot isolate herself from the rest of the world due to the characteristics of its economy and thus need to embrace globalisation by tap on the various opportunities while undertaking various measures to minimise the risks.",,
"Recent developments, such as improvement in the state of technology, nation-wide wireless internet access and phenomenal growth in emerging economies like China and India, have affected the demand for and supply of netbooks, laptops, desktop computers and similar products.
Discuss how the abovementioned markets could be impacted by these developments. [25]","Demand refers to the willingness and ability of consumers to buy a good at various prices, ceteris paribus while supply refers to the willingness and ability of firms to produce a good at various prices, ceteris paribus. The actions of buyers and sellers in the market will determine the market equilibrium price and output.
If the price is P1, quantity demanded > quantity supplied  shortage of Q1Q2 consumers who are willing and able will bid up the prices in order to get the good while producers will respond to the higher prices by  quantity supplied.
If the price is P2, quantity supplied > quantity demanded  surplus of Q1Q2  producers will lower prices in order to get rid of excess stocks while consumers will respond to the lower prices by  quantity demanded.
The above processes will continue until the shortage and surplus are eliminated at P0 where quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. Hence, equilibrium price is P0 and output is Q0.
Body
a) With improvements in technology, it makes it possible for wireless internet access to be
available to many people, thereby  supply of wireless internet service. Eg:
Recent developments in mobile internet allow people to have access to broadband-on- the-go with the aid of a small device.
From figure 2, such  in supply of wireless internet service from SS0 to SS1   price from P0 to P1 and  quantity from Q0 to Q1. Since wireless internet service is a complement for wireless-enabled mobile devices such as netbooks and laptops demand for such mobile devices from DD0 to DD1 in figure 3shortageUpward pressure on price. Eventually, a new market equilibrium is reached where quantity demanded will once again be equal to the quantity supplied   equilibrium price from P0 to P1 and  equilibrium quantity from Q0 to 

Briefly explain IED
 Income elasticity of demand (IED) measures the degree of responsiveness of DD for a
good due to a change in consumers’ income, ceteris paribus.
 A good that has positive income elasticity of demand is one in which the demand for the
good rises when the income rises and falls when income falls, ceteris paribus. Such goods are known as normal goods. A good that has negative income elasticity of demand is one in which the demand for the good falls when the income rises and rises when income falls, ceteris paribus. Such goods are known as inferior goods.
 For 0<IED<1, DD is said to be income inelastic because these goods are necessities whereby  income  less than proportionate  demand (there is only so much an individual needs to consume for a necessity), ceteris paribus. For IED>1, demand is said to be income elastic because these goods are luxury goods. When incomes are rising strongly and consumers go ahead with “big-ticket” items, the demand for luxury goods will rise more than proportionately.
 DD for these consumer electronic products is likely to be income elastic as they are not a necessity and can be generally treated as luxury goods.
 Phenomenal growth in China and India   national income   purchasing power  significant  demand for these consumer electronic productsgreater rightward shift in DD curve from DD0 to DD2, rather than from DD0 to DD1 in figure 4  larger shortage at prevailing market price  greater  equilibrium price and  equilibrium quantity from P0 to P2 and from Q0 to Q2 respectively

Briefly explain CED
 Cross elasticity of demand (CED) measures the degree of responsiveness of demand for
a good due to a change in price of a related good, ceteris paribus.
 If its sign is (-), both goods are complements because  price of good Y   quantity
demanded for good Y   demand for good X. If its sign is (+), both goods are substitutes because  price of good Y quantity demanded for good Y demand for good X
 For 0<CED<1, demand is said to be cross price inelastic because these goods are weak complements or substitutes whereby  price of good Y  less than proportionate  demand for good X (complements) or less than proportionate  demand for good X (substitutes), ceteris paribus. For CED>1, DD is said to be cross price elastic because these goods are strong complements or substitutes whereby  price of good Y  more than proportionate  demand for good X (complements) or more than proportionate  demand for good X (substitutes), ceteris paribus.
 Netbooks and laptops are likely to be strong substitutes for desktop computers because they serve similar needs of performing work by students or office workers. In other words, the demand for desktop computer is highly cross price elastic with respect to the price of netbooks and laptops.
 With  price of netbooks and laptops  more than proportionate  demand for desktop computers, ceteris paribus  surplus  downward pressure on prices  new equilibrium price and quantity are lower
Conclusion
Improvement in technology is a key factor which drives the markets for the said items and similar products. This coupled with a busy lifestyle whereby people are required to access their work while on the move would mean that the markets for new mobile devices will only grow while the markets for old devices will shrink in the long run.",,
Explain how firms in monopolistic competition and oligopoly compete in their respective market structure. [10] ,"Introduction:
 Briefly state the key features of firms in monopolistic competition and oligopoly
Body:
Firms in monopolistic competition are price setters since they have some degree of market power and the demand for their good is highly price elastic due to their products being slightly differentiated from other close substitutesengage in price competition via discountsfall in price leads to a more than proportionate rise in Qdd, ceteris paribus rise in TR
Given that it is not sustainable to engage in price competition, these firms also engage in non-price competitionreal or imaginary product differentiation as well as advertising With advertising, demand for their product increases due to perceived superiority in the quality of their goods over their rivalsrise in TRIn the context that rise in TR > rise in TCrise in profits.
Firms in oligopoly observe a mutual interdependence characteristicprice rigidity in non- collusive oligopoly market since any increase or reduction in price will lead to the firm experiencing a fall in its TR  Assuming constant cost, lower profits will result if oligopolistic firms engage in price competition.
Since the firms could not engage in price competition, they resort to non-price competition such as product development and branding. For example, the major aims of product development are to produce a product that will sell well (i.e. one in high or potentially high demand) and that is different from rivals’ products, which means that it has a relatively price inelastic demand due to lack of close substitutesrise in demandrise in TR Assuming cost constant, profit is higher.
Alternatively, firms in oligopoly may also collude to drive out other competitors in the market.
A4: Firms in oligopoly may collude by mutually agreeing to fix price or output  For example, collusion could take place informally under the price leadership model whereby the firm with the largest market share might choose to set a price that does not maximise short-run profits for the industry. The other firms in the collusion would also follow suit. Another purpose of limit pricing is to drive out the existing smaller competitors in the market since the smaller firms are not able to match the low price without incurring substantial losses
Conclusion:
In my opinion, competition to some extent is good for existing firms since it motivates them to be cost-efficient but when practised excessively, it may be detrimental to the consumers.",,
Discuss whether there is more innovation and greater consumer welfare in oligopoly than in monopolistic competition. [15],"Introduction:
The level of innovation could depend on the amount of profits that firms in both market structures earn in the long run. Consumer welfare could depend on the following variables such as price and quality of the product and variety of products available for the consumers.
Body:
An oligopolist has the incentive and ability to invest in large-scale research and development (R&D) programmes for his product. This is because firstly, he is likely to have the funds due to his ability to earn supernormal profits in the long run as there are high barriers to entry.
Since R&D brings about cheaper methods of production and new products, consumers can enjoy better quality products. In addition, more innovative methods of productioncheaper production methodslower unit cost of productionpass on to consumers in the form of lower priceconsumer surplus highergreater consumer welfare
Monopolistic competition may not have the excess profits to engage in R&D. In the long-run, new firms can enter and existing firms can exit from the industry in response to the level of profits due to low barriers to entry and exitmake normal profitslack of funds to engage in R&Dlack of innovationquality of products may be compromisedlower consumer welfare in monopolistic competition
Oligopoly has greater consumer welfare than monopolistic competition due to economies of large scale production.
Firms in oligopoly tend to dominate the market  tend to produce on a larger scale of production since they cater to a larger market demand compared to firms in monopolistic competition firms in oligopoly able to enjoy economies of large scale production since they can buy inputs in bulk at a discounted price since suppliers are keen to maintain business relation with big buyers  lower unit cost of production in oligopoly than in monopolistic competition

Since the costs in oligopoly are lower than those in monopolistic competition, the former will produce and sell a higher output, which is Qo, at a lower price of Po  higher consumer welfare in oligopoly
There could be greater consumer welfare in monopolistic competition than in oligopoly due to the differences in market power.
The degree of market power for firms in an oligopolistic market is relatively greater than that of firms in a monopolistically competitive market  firms in an oligopolistic market have a greater tendency to exploit consumers due to greater degree of market power  price set by firms in an oligopolistic market tend to be higher since demand for the goods/services tend to be relatively more price inelastic as compared to firms in a monopolistically competitive marketOligopolistic firm charges a higher priceGreater consumer welfare in monopolistic competition
Monopolistic competition offers a greater variety of products due to many close substitutes available, But in oligopoly, due to a few dominant sellers in the market, there could be a lack of variety of goods/servicesconsumer welfare greater in monopolistic competition than in oligopoly
Monopolistic competition can also have greater innovation and consumer welfare due to the number of firms in the industry compared to oligopoly.
Since there are many firms in monopolistic competition, there is a competitive pressure on profitMore efficient methods of productionlower prices for consumers. Additionally, engage in R&Dimprove quality of product and expand variety of product
Conclusion:
Given the possibility of reaping large economies of scale and supernormal profits in the long run in oligopoly, there could be more innovation and consumer welfare in the latter than in monopolistic competition. However, for certain goods and services, monopolistic competition could bring about more consumer welfare.

"Living in a global city comes with costs; worsening traffic congestion and income inequality.
(a) Explain why traffic congestion and income inequality may lead to market failure. [10]","
1. Market Failure is undesirable because resource allocation concerning what, how, how much and for whom to produce using the market/price mechanism fails to achieve efficiency in allocation of scarce resources. Hence society’s welfare is not maximised.
2. Equity in income distribution is to ensure a more equal distribution of income and wealth. It is usually measured by the Gini coefficient where the closer the value is to 1, the higher the income inequality in the country.
II. Body
 Negative externalities are external cost to third parties who are not directly involved in using the car, and they are not compensated for the damages incurred by them. For example, traffic congestion generates noise and air pollution that adversely affect the quality of living for residents living near the congested roads and increase their medical cost.
 Because of the presence of negative externalities, there is a divergence between marginal private cost (MPC) and the marginal social cost (MSC) by the extent of the marginal external cost (MEC). In order to obtain MSC, MEC is added to MPC.

Assuming that there is no external benefit, marginal private benefit (MPB) is equal to marginal social benefit (MSB).
When left to the free market, motorists only consider their private cost and benefit but ignore the external costs they impose on third parties. The satisfaction- maximizing motorists only consider their own private benefit and cost and will ignore the external costs incurred in using their car. Hence they will use their cars (or road) to a point where MPB=MPC i.e. at point E0. Thus the market equilibrium

quantity of car usage is 0Qm. The social optimum level is obtained when MSB equals to the MSC at point E1 with a level of car usage at 0Qs
 If left alone, the price mechanism will bring about a level of car usage (0Qm) that is higher than what is deemed to be socially desirable (0Qs). There is an over- usage of cars by QmQs as Qm is greater than Qs, leading to an inefficient allocation. Thus there is a total welfare loss (deadweight loss) of area E0E1A to the society.
Market may fail to the extent that they fail to achieve other social objectives such as greater equality in the distribution of income. Even if resources are efficiently allocated, their effect on equity may not be optimal from the social or political perspective.
In a market-based economy, price mechanism solves the basic problems of what and how much, how to and or whom to produce. As resources are allocated through the price mechanism, the free play of market forces of demand and supply determines the price which then acts as a signal to firms to allocate scarce resources. In addition, different people are willing and able to pay different prices. This difference in purchasing power determines for whom the goods are produced. Since the price mechanism is driven by consumer sovereignty, only goods that people are willing and able to buy are produced.
Consumers’ money votes determine what is actually produced and those with more money will be able to consume more of the goods produced. As the rich has more dollar votes than the poor, resources would be allocated through the price mechanism such that more luxury goods such as golf courses would be produced.
In such a situation, there is unsatisfactory or unfair allocation of resources. The society’s welfare is not maximised as certain needs of the population are not fulfilled. As such, the free market has failed to achieve a socially desirable allocation of resources to maximize social welfare. The greater the income inequality (i.e. the closer the Gini coefficient is to the value 1), the more socially undesirable is the allocation of resources.
Conclusion
In both cases, market failure results and society’s welfare is not maximised. Traffic congestion is a result of an over-usage of road space. On the other hand, for income inequality, it results in an unsatisfactory allocation of resources as the price mechanism fails to take into account the needs of the low-income earners.

Living in a global city comes with costs; worsening traffic congestion and income inequality. Assess the policies currently used by the Singapore government to deal with the above market failures. [15],"Introduction
As income inequality and traffic congestion result in market failure and thus society’s welfare is not maximised, there is a need for the Singapore government to intervene.
Body
Singapore is probably the first city in the world to invent a full electronic road pricing (ERP) scheme. All cars are fitted with a tracking and charging device. The electronic device mounted on a car is triggered if the car enters a congested area and appropriate charge will be levied according to the amount of congestion. ERP allows government to charge different rates at different times of the day based on the severity of the traffic congestion.

 If the ERP charge is calculated to reflect accurately the marginal external cost, then the motorist is said to internalise the external cost. The resulting higher total cost of car usage will shift MPC to the left to MSC = MPC + ERP charge. Hence there is a reduction in car usage from 0Qm to the socially optimal level of 0Qs, where the marginal social cost is equal to the marginal social benefit (MSB=MSC). The welfare loss arising from over-usage of cars is thus eliminated.
 ERP is a fair system as the charges are based on usage so that who contributes more to congestion pay more, which is similar to the “polluter pays” principle. Those who use roads less frequently or who travel during non ERP hours pay less.
 The aim of the Singapore government is to make public transport an attractive alternative to driving cars. This is being carried out by improving the existing infrastructure through building a more efficient public transport system.
 In addition the government also makes use of technology in the area of shortening waiting time and making information on waiting time more readily available for consumers through investment in the latest technology.
 Difficult to balance between providing quality nationwide accessible public transport and keeping costs low and hence, affordable for users. The burden of the costs of providing public transport (if government has to subsidise) will eventually fall on taxpayers.
By taxing the rich proportionately more than the poor, the post-tax distribution of income will be more equal than the pre-tax distribution. The more progressive the tax system, the more incomes will be equally distributed.
 The imposition of progressive income tax could have a negative impact on the incentive to work. High marginal tax rates can create disincentives for people who are close to the next tax bracket to work harder and gain more income. If this happens, scarce resources are not being used to their effect and there is inefficiency.
Subsidies, such as cash benefits like Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) are also given by the Singapore government. Subsidies would lessen inequality as they account for a larger proportion of a poor person’s income than a rich person’s.
 For WIS:
Since it requires one to be employed to receive the benefits, it fails to target the elderly and sickly poor who are genuinely unemployed.
Conclusion
Marking Scheme
12
As far as dealing with traffic congestion is concerned, the Singapore government has implemented a package of policies that seeks to reduce traffic congestion by addressing car usage and quality of public transport. In the area of addressing the issue of income inequality, the policies supported by a multi-tier social security system could turn the tide on inequality and ensure that the gains from economic growth are more widely shared.

"To be considered successful, an economy needs to achieve long-term economic growth and stability.
(a) Explain this statement. [10]","I. Introduction
1. According to the above preamble, the key macroeconomic objectives of a successful economy are achieving long term economic growth and stability. The attainment of these macroeconomic objectives is important to any economy as the respective macroeconomic objective can individually lead to the attainment of other economic objectives.
II. Body
2. Economic growth takes place when there is an increase in the country’s real GNP.
To increase the standard of living: Economic growth means that national income increases. Ceteris paribus, this means that people’s purchasing power has increased. Hence, they are able to buy and enjoy more goods and services, leading to a rise in their material aspect of standard of living. Economic growth means that government can collect more tax revenues to finance expenditure on infrastructure, education and health care. All these will mean that the citizens are able to enjoy a higher level of economic welfare which is especially beneficial for developing countries.
To bring about greater equality in income distribution: Where there is economic growth, there will be an increase in government tax revenues. This makes it easier for govt to redistribute income to poor, without the need to raise tax rates. These tax revenues can be redistributed to the poor in the form of subsidies.
3. Low inflation represents price stability and creates confidence in people within the economy. It creates a more certain environment in which both businesses and households can plan and operate more efficiently. It is an essential ingredient for sustainable growth in investment, output and jobs.
With low inflation, firms are better able to predict future revenue, costs and thus profits with greater certainty. Foreign investors may also be attracted to invest in the country due to relatively lower costs compared to other countries with higher inflation rates.
With low inflation relative to other countries, this allows a country to enjoy export competitiveness, where exports become relatively cheaper. This would lead to an increase in the demand for exports. Hence total revenue from exports increases. As such there is an improvement in BOP.
4. An open economy will have a balance of payments account. The balance of payments is a record of a country’s international transactions between its residents and those of the rest of the world over a period of time. It records the flow of goods and services, gifts and assets between the residents of a country and those of other countries over a period of time. One of the aims of the government is to maintain a healthy balance of payments, which is usually associated with a balance of payments surplus
A BOP surplus could reflect an economy that is fundamentally strong. This will enable the economy to increase its international competitiveness. Attracts investment which increases AD propelling greater employment and economic growth. Since rise in investment in capital goods, increases productive capacity of economy which increases LRAS. Thus sustained economic growth goal achieved.
III. Conclusion
Achieving the three key macroeconomic goals has always been important. Without growth, peoples’ standard of living will not increase, and if inflation is too high then the value of money falls, negating any increase in money incomes. It is worth-noting that one of the missions of the Monetary Authority of Singapore is to promote sustained non-inflationary economic growth.",,
"To be considered successful, an economy needs to achieve long-term economic growth and stability.
(b) Discuss whether supply-side policies are the most effective way for Singapore to sustain a successful economy. [15]"," Introduction
1. As Singapore lacks natural resources and is heavily dependent on international trade, long-term economic growth and stability in Singapore hinge on the quality of its human labour and its export competitiveness and the quality of its human capital. In this light, effective supply-side policies can be used to achieve both long-term economic growth, internal stability, i.e. low inflation, and external stability, i.e. satisfactory BOP.
Body
Supply-side policies can achieve long-term economic growth in Singapore.
 In order to achieve sustainable rates of economic growth and thus avoiding overheating of the economy, we must increase the productive capacity of the economy by increasing the quantity of resources (i.e. natural resources, labour or capital) and efficiency with which these resources are used, through advances in technology,
improved labour skills or improved organisation.
 Interventionist supply-side policies are adopted by the Singapore government to
increase AS. For example, intervention can take the form grants for research and development. Successful R&D could bring about an improvement in the state of technology.
 By doing so, the aggregate supply increases. Hence, LRAS will increase and the LRAS curve will shift to the right from LRAS to LRAS1. There is an increase in the full- employment level of national output or potential output from Yf0 to Yf1, which represents long-run economic growth.


Evaluation
Supply-side policies help to reduce inflation because there is a fall in the general price level from P0 to P1. At the same time, they promote long term growth and a satisfactory balance of payments via increased export competitiveness and creating a more conducive environment for foreign direct investment. Hence there is no conflict with the macroeconomic goals of long term economic growth and stability. As such, supply-side policies are vital in sustaining a successful economy.
Demand-side Policy (e.g. Fiscal Policy)
Expansionary fiscal policies such as lowering of personal/corporate income taxes and/or increasing government expenditure can stimulate actual growth.
↑G on final goods & services such as building infrastructure, spending on education and healthcare↑AE.
↑AE ↑incentive of firms to produce more due to higher expected profits  assuming economy is at less than full employment, multiplied ↑ real national output, ↑ NY and employment, thus boost economic growth. With strong actual economic growth, there would be a rise in investors’ optimism, which would lead to a rise in investment. When this happens, the productive capacity in the economy would expand, shifting LRAS curve to the right, hence achieving long-run economic growth and stability.

Evaluation
 Small size of Singapore’s multiplier, which is due to high MPW arising from high MPS and MPM.
Hence expansionary fiscal policy is ineffective to stimulate growth because with a small multiplier value, the final rise in national income is limited. Therefore, government may have to spend even more or reduce tax further in order to achieve the desired outcome. This will pose a financial strain on government during lean budget years.
Exchange Rate Policy
Singapore is very dependent on trade. As such, exchange rate policy also plays a vital role in helping Singapore achieve long-term economic growth and stability.
The Singapore government allows the Singapore dollar (SGD) to appreciate. When SGD appreciates, the price of imported raw materials would fall in domestic currency. This would reduce the cost of production, leading to a rise in AS. When this happens, general price level would fall, contributing to a fall in import-price-push inflation. This would help to achieve price stability in Singapore.
Evaluation
However, unlike supply-side policies, exchange rate policy only addresses the issue of the price competitiveness of exports. In addition, it also has possible negative impact on export price competitiveness when the price of exports rises in foreign currency due to appreciation of SGD. Hence, this is only a short-term measure.
Conclusion
In order to achieve long-term economic growth and stability so as to sustain a successful economy, it appears that supply-side policies are the main policy of choice.
However, the government must anticipate and respond to external events well. In today’s rapidly changing situation, the government must be swift in recognising the current economic climate, so as to help them to identify their top priority and address the most urgent problems first, usually via demand-side policies such as the fiscal policies, in order to stabilize the economy and eventually achieve sustained growth and stability in the long run.",,
Discuss the impact of globalisation and capital flows on the Singapore economy. [25],"Introduction:
 Define globalization: a process of continuing integration of the countries in the world where national markets become increasingly interlinked
 Briefly state the factors which drive globalization: Accelerating pace of globalisation due to reduced trade barriers and technical progress especially in information technology and significant fall in transportation costs
Body:
Globalisation has led to a rapid expansion of international trade in goods and services through trade liberalisations and regional trading arrangementstrade creation as there is an increased in volume of trade  rising share of imports and exports in GDP clearly indicates the growing exposure of national economies to international trade  larger scale of productionallows for specialization to take place based on Singapore’s comparative advantagelower unit cost of producing final good/servicemore price competitive exports  given demand for exports is price elastic due to many close substitutes available quantity demanded for exports rises more than proportionately, ceteris paribusrise in total revenue of exportsrise in (X-M)

The impact of a rise in net exports can be illustrated by an upward shift of the AE curve from AE to AE1. Hence there is economic growth which is seen by the rise in national income from Ye to Yf. Additionally, unemployment would fall due to a rise in the derived demand for labour.
Given Singapore’s nature of being heavily dependent on external demand to propel her economy due to her small domestic market, trade creation which increases her (X-M) will benefit Singapore’s economy to a large extent.
Globalization allows sharing of expertise knowledge amongst countries and greater mobility of labour between countriesrise in quantity and quality of resourcesrise in productive capacity of economyrise in LRASrise in full employment level of real national output
Singapore benefits from this positive impact by a large extent as she needs to continuously be on par with the latest technological advancement in her production process so as to remain competitive in the international market since she is heavily reliant on external demand to propel her economy.

With greater capital flows in the form of FDIs and hot moneycapital inflowcapital account improves
Given rise in (X-M)current account improves, ceteris paribus
Since both capital and current accounts improveBOP improves
Rapid globalizationdeveloping countries such as China open their market to international trade and capital flows  made a breakthrough in producing low-end manufactured goods at lower opportunity cost with her relative abundance of low-wage labour  gained comparative advantage in producing low-end manufactured goods. Thus, Singapore lost her comparative advantage to Chinafall in demand for Singapore’s low-end manufactured goods since China’s low-end manufactured goods are substitutes for Singapore’s  occupational immobilitystructural unemployment arises
This negative impact is cushioned by Singapore’s appropriate measure of sending her workers for training/retrainingstructural unemployment problem can be reduced in the future
With increasing interconnectedness among national markets, Singapore is more susceptible to economic recession or inflation due to trading partners experiencing changes in economic conditions.
However, Singapore was able to tide through these economic problems faced quite smoothly given the appropriate policies the government implemented to cushion the negative impact of recession
Globalisation has led to greater financial flows across national border. Total foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in the world increased. With the latter, it has resulted in exposure to new ideas, technology and products. New technology, in both advanced and developing economies, creates greater demands for those with higher skills. In advanced economies such as Singapore, the use of technology is widespread in both manufacturing and services, raising the skills premium in a substantial portion of the economy  widening income gap between the two groups of peopleinequity in income distribution
Singapore has been taking pro-active approach to narrow income gap so as to minimize social tensions. For example, by making education compulsory for every resident, it ensures that they have basic literacy skills. Rebates and subsidies are also given to the lower-income group in order to raise their disposable income.
Globalization which allows for greater capital flows in terms of more FDIs in Singapore can impact Singapore negatively in future  when profits earned from the FDIs are taken back to their respective countries  large amount of income earned to abroad would flow out of Singaporecurrent account could worsen in the future
The negative impact is highly unlikely to occur in the near future because given the current trend in Singapore’s BOP, her current account has been in a healthy surplus for a consistent period of time.
Conclusion:
Because of its small domestic market and lack of natural resources, Singapore is dependent on trade and FDI. With globalisation, there are more benefits than costs to the Singapore economy when it expands trade relations with more countries and experiences an improvement in the state of technology which has a positive impact on the quality of its exports.",,
Explain the main causes of a balance of payments deficit of a country. [10] ,"Intro
 Balance of payments is a record of a country’s international transactions between its
residents and those of the rest of the world over a period of time.
 It is made up of the current account which records the total value of exports and imports
of currently produced goods and services, investment incomes and unilateral transfers as well as the capital account which records the inflow and outflow of currency resulting from sales and purchases of assets.
Body
 In 2009, the US sub-prime crisis led to a world-wide recession including the US. Since
US is a major trading partner of many countries, this will lead to
o DD the country’s exports export revenue
o Ceteris paribus, with  export revenue and a constant import expenditure  this
would lead to a current account deficit and thus BOP deficit
 When there is higher inflation in the country relative to its trading partners
o P exportsassuming that the demand for exports is price elasticmore than
proportionate Qd exports export revenue
o Imports are now relatively cheaperDD imports import expenditure
o Ceteris paribus, with  export revenue +  import expenditure  this would lead to a
current account deficit and thus BOP deficit, ceteris paribus.
 The business climate of a country depends on several factors such as government policies (tax rates, subsidies), labour productivity, infrastructure, etc.
 When there is a less conducive business environment such as a fall in labour productivity  unit labour cost of productionIsince the expected rate of return falls capital outflow  this will lead to a capital account and thus BOP deficit.
Conclusion
With globalisation, the world economies are increasingly getting more and more interconnected. This implies that the economic conditions of a country’s trading partners such as income and price levels are likely to be the main causes of a country’s BOP deficit.",,

incomplete. Candidates are to note that “BOP consists of current and capital accounts” is not the definition of BOP.
Discuss whether Singapore has the most to gain as a result of a depreciation of the Singapore dollar. [15]
Intro
 The Monetary Authority of Singapore has been using the exchange rate policy where it
allows a gradual appreciation of SGD to help achieve a non-inflationary sustainable growth. However, under some economic conditions, such as the 2009 recession triggered by the US sub-prime crisis, the SGD was allowed to depreciate.
Body
 During the 2009 economic recession, our government allowed SGD to depreciate
because the most important economic goal back then was to cushion the impact of the US sub-prime crisis against a falling external demand which resulted in falling national income and employment in Spore.
 A depreciation of SGD results in a fall in prices of exports in foreign currency and rise in prices of imports in domestic currency. Assuming DDx and DDm are price elastic  more than proportionate Qd exports and more than proportionate Qd imports export revenue +  import expenditure(X – M)ceteris paribus, improvement in current account.
 Since it was a period of recession, investors were generally pessimistic. A weak SGD would further result in a loss of confidence in the Singapore economy as it suggests that the economy is fundamentally unsoundoutflow of capital thus worsening capital account
 Ceteris paribus, overall BOP may improve if (X – M) can offset a worsening capital account.
Evaluation
 However, in the short-run, depreciation may worsen Singapore's current balance
because the demand for exports and imports is very price inelastic. As a result, net exports would fall, rather than rise. This, coupled with the worsening capital account, would result in a worsening BOP for Singapore.
 With depreciation which leads to (X – M)  AD  This rise in aggregate demand, ceteris paribus, will cause a shortage of goods and services and thus exert an upward pressure on prices. Firms will have more incentive to increase production and hire more workers. Hence, unemployment falls and national income increases.
Evaluation
 Depreciation of SGD only allows us to artificially obtain a competitive edge against
others.
 A weak SGD may lead to a rise in the general price level because of AD as shown above if economy is near or at full employment.
 In addition, a weak SGD also leads to rise in prices of imported final goods and services

Evaluation
 However, if depreciation of SGD was done during periods of recession where demand is
generally low, prices of imported final goods and services and raw materials may not increase substantially.
 The sub-prime crisis, which resulted in a fall in world incomes, led to a fall in the DD for our exports. If depreciating the SGD is a policy to address this, it allows us to boost our export competitiveness which results in  export revenue and at the same time, switching our expenditure on imports towards domestically produced import-substitutes. These led to a rise in domestic production and created employment since labour is a derived DD.
 Given that our domestic market is small with only five million people, growth and employment are contributed largely by selling our exports overseas. Depreciation does help to boost economic growth and employment substantially compared to other ways.
 As shown above, a depreciation of SGD allowed us to achieve 3 of the 4 macroeconomic goals.
 However, in the long run, a weak SGD could result in high import prices which erode our export competitiveness. This in turn leads to negative impact on BOP, growth and employment. Hence, it is at best an interim measure to revive our economy.
 Depreciation will increase Singapore’s volume of exports and this may prompt foreign countries to retaliate by devaluing their currencies or impose trade barriers to discourage the exports of Singapore
 However, other countries may not retaliate if
o theyseeusasasmallcountrywithlimitedimpactontheireconomies
Conclusion
 Based on the above discussion, given the characteristics of Singapore and if SGD was
allowed to depreciate to address recession due to fall in external demand, then we have the most to gain provided our trading partners do not retaliate. Having said this, if we do not suffer from recession, a depreciation of SGD would result in more harm than gain for our economy.",,
"As the world experiences soaring international oil prices, countries like Malaysia and Indonesia have provided fuel subsidies while Singapore and Australia have not.
Discuss the impact of soaring international oil prices and fuel subsidies on society. [25]","Approach:
Candidates should recognise that soaring international oil prices can be explained using a Demand/Supply/elasticity (DSE) framework. Although not explicitly required by the question, the possible DSE reasons for soaring international oil prices should be briefly explained/described (as it may have some bearing on the impact on the various sectors of the society). Candidates must use the DSE framework and welfare concepts (consumer and producer surplus) to evaluate how society, broadly (1) crude oil producers (e.g. oil producing countries, oil producing firms etc), (2) crude oil consumers (e.g. oil refining firms, manufacturing industries, consumers of processed fuel – households and firms etc) will be impacted (negatively or positively) by soaring oil prices. Clear illustrations using clearly labelled diagrams and good examples are a requirement for strong marks. Strong candidates might even differentiate the analysis further by evaluating how the impact on specific groups within a broad group might be different (e.g. low- income vs high-income households, manufacturing sector vs service sector firms). As the question hints that some countries (governments) have implemented fuel subsidies, candidates must evaluate (using the DSE and welfare/efficient concepts) how the fuel subsidies (e.g. price ceiling, subsidies) might have affected the respective impact on the various sectors (include government) of the society. Therefore, diagrams and examples showing fuel subsidies measures must be included.

 Subsidies have positive and/or negative effects on consumers (firms which use oil and households) and the government. We also need to consider the impact on allocative efficiency and equity.
Body
Impact of soaring international oil prices
1. Explain reasons for soaring oil prices Demand side:
- Rising demand caused by increased demand from industrialized countries and rapidly
expanding economies such as China and India which need oil for production. Rising affluence leading to a greater need for crude oil which is processed into fuel mainly used for transport, manufacturing for industrial products, electricity generation
- Hedge funds and other speculators betting on the possibility of higher prices have exacerbated price pressure in the market.
Supply side:
- Slow down in oil supply growth, crude oil is a limited resource, and the remaining accessible
reserves are more technically difficult to extract.
- Events such as violence in the Middle East have led to disruptions in oil supply.
- Climate changes, freezing weather, storms, caused disruptions to the shipments of crude
oil.
- Restriction of supply by OPEC.
(Accept explanation for no change in supply)
The increase in demand coupled with a fall in supply lead to the increase in oil prices. Large increase in price as the demand is price inelastic due to the lack of substitutes and supply for it is rather price inelastic as it is difficult to extract oil in the short run.

2. Negative impact of soaring international oil prices
 Consumer of crude oil will be negatively affected. The consumers of oil include oil refinery
firms and households. As prices increase sharply, these consumers will face an increase in
Quantity
total expenditure (P x Q) of area P2bQ1Q20. Show increase in total expenditure with reference to a diagram. EV: The impact could be more adverse for low-income consumers as a larger proportion of income is spent on fuel to generate power for basic needs e.g. lighting, electrical appliances. The impact could be less adverse on firms which are in the services industry where their dependence on fuel might be lower. Oil refinery industries (Venezuela, South Korea, Singapore) experience increase in cost of production and hence see falling profits. EV: The demand for processed fuel is also inelastic, therefore these firms can transfer the increase in cost of production to the buyers of processed fuel. Households experience higher cost of living which adversely affects their standard of living. EV: Those living in countries such as Australia and Singapore which do not provide fuel subsidies will experience a greater rise in cost of living compared to countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia which provide subsidies.
 (Answers which explain impact of soaring international on macro economic objectives are acceptable but must ultimately link answers to impact on households, workers, firms)
3. Positive impact of soaring international oil prices
 As oil faced a sharp increase in price, oil producers will benefit. As prices increase sharply,
total revenue (P X Q) earned will be much higher. Increase in total revenue is area P2bQ1Q20. Countries in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia and Iran will see huge increases in revenue as they control a large proportion of the world’s oil reserves. EV: Their governments do not need to tax to raise tax revenue, therefore consumers and producers in such countries benefit as they not need to pay taxes.
 (This market has –ve externalities. Production/consumption of oil results in pollution that is harmful to the health of 3rd parties. Briefly explain that the market mechanism results in over-production of petrol resulting in welfare loss. With less quantity produced/consumed soaring international oil prices reduces allocative inefficiency and hence causes less welfare loss.)
Impact of fuel subsidies
1. Explain fuel subsidies
The rationale for implementing fuel subsidies is to help firms which use fuel lower cost of productions so that their goods are cheaper and also as it is a basic necessity for households, so the subsidies help households especially the poor afford it.
Types of fuel subsidies
a) A subsidy given by the government has the effect of decreasing the marginal cost of production. Imposing a subsidy will shift the supply rightwards, i.e. supply increases. Producers will now need a lower price to offer the same quantity for sale. (Explain with reference to a diagram)

b) The government may impose a maximum price on fuel which means consumers of fuel pay the maximum price. The government then compensates petrol producers the difference between the market price and the maximum price.
2. Positive impact of fuel subsidies
 Consumers of petrol enjoy lower prices because of the subsidy. For households, they will
enjoy greater consumer surplus (can refer to a diagram, increased consumer surplus of area
P1eyP2) and lower cost of living.
EV: But these subsidies benefit both the poor and the rich households alike as everyone enjoys the same benefits of the subsidy. It seems that the subsidies mainly benefit the richer owners of cars and air-conditioners. Thus, equity in income distribution could be worsened.
 Firms which use petrol in their production (e.g. for transportation) will benefit as the subsidy allows them to reduce their cost of production. This allows them to enjoy greater profits.
EV: These subsidies will lead to firms and their shareholders gaining significantly which may worsen the income equality in the country.
 Firms in countries which has fuel subsidies will be able to continue their production at a lower cost and this provides them with an advantage in terms of competitiveness in exports. EV: this distortion in the opportunity cost distorts the comparative advantage of the country and as a result specialise in the production in a ‘wrong’ industry.
 (Answers which explain impact of subsidies on macro economic objectives are acceptable but must ultimately link answers to impact on households, workers, firms)
3. Negative impact of fuel subsidies
 If the initial equilibrium output was allocative efficient, then the provision of a subsidy in such
a market will result in welfare loss. With reference to the subsidy diagram, - Assume that the initial equilibrium output, Q1 is allocative efficient (MSB = MSC). The rise in supply causes the equilibrium price to fall to P2 and output to rise to Q2. The resulting rise in output by Q2 – Q1 units causes a welfare loss equal to area exy. This is because for each of the

Q2 – Q1 units, MSB < MSC which means there would have been a net welfare loss in producing those units.
 Furthermore, this market has –ve externalities. Production of petrol results in pollution that is harmful to the health of 3rd parties. Briefly explain that the market mechanism results in over-production of petrol resulting in welfare loss.

By increasing production/consumption of petrol, production subsidy worsens allocative inefficiency and hence causes greater welfare loss (rises from area fde to fxy). This is an example of govt failure. With the current practice of heavily subsidizing petrol, industries have less incentive to continually lower costs as compared to rivals in other countries. Over time, this is indeed a serious issue as foreign producers become more competitive whilst the local producers become “addicted” to cheap fuel.
 In addition, these subsidies may distort opportunity cost of the country as the price of petrol is artificially low. Firms in the countries with these subsidies may benefit from lower cost of production and consume petrol beyond its true opportunity cost. This distorts the efficient allocation of resources further.
 These subsidies are a huge strain on the government budget. These means that there is money spent on other important sectors of the economy such as health, education and infrastructure which may affect standard of living. Countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia are spending huge amounts on subsidies causing them to face budget deficits which have adverse effects on society. Furthermore, the government may increase taxes to fund the subsidies. For example, increase in personal income tax which leads to fall in disposable income which means households will have less purchasing power, and this affects their standard of living.
Conclusion
Soaring oil prices though have benefited crude oil producers have led to relatively more significant negative impact on society. Some governments around the world have reacted with

the introduction of fuel subsidies to increase affordability of this necessity. The impact of the soaring oil prices and fuel subsidies vary from country to country.
With continued rising oil prices, the amount spent by governments on such subsidies will not be sustainable. The benefit of affordable prices for the poor will come at a very high opportunity cost - e.g. forgo expenditure on investments needed for economic growth. These subsidies are at best temporary measure as it distorts the efficient working of the price mechanism.
Alternative solutions to tackling high oil prices include governments encouraging firms to use more fuel-efficient technology. Although this may require funds and a significant period of time, it may be a better long term to address the adverse impact of high oil prices.",,
"Barriers to entry confer more market power on firms in their pricing and output decisions and behaviour.
a. Using examples, explain how barriers to entry will confer more market power on firms. [10m]","Candidates should use at least 3 (different types/nature) examples of barriers to entry and explain clearly how each BTE will confer more market power on firms. Types of BTE include natural (EOS, control of raw materials, localized monopolist) or artificial ones (legal barriers, deterrence strategies). Concepts like market share, lesser substitutes, more inelastic demand etc are important concepts to be applied in the answer. An illustration with a diagram will be an excellent way to conclude the answer.
Introduction
Barriers to entry (BTEs) are obstacles or restrictions that make it difficult or impossible for new firms to enter an industry. BTEs can be artificial or natural. The degree or extent of BTEs will determine the level of market power and competition in an industry. Typically for industries will high barriers to entry, the firms will generally have higher market power.
Explain how more market power is conferred:
The extent to which a firm can exercise its influence on market power is an indication of its market power. The number and size of firms, nature of product and barriers to entry contributes to a firms’ market power. The more market power a firm has determines the slope of the demand curve (more price inelastic demand and less substitutes - higher price a firm can charge)
Example 1
 Naturial -- EOS
o Industries such as telecommunications and utilities usually have very high fixed cost and often requires a large output to spread out the large fixed costs (i.e. reach MES). As the MC or variable cost of supplying extra output is very low relative to the fixed cost, the AC is falling throughout the entire range of the market demand curve. For example, setting up the extensive network of power stations and cables to distribute electricity is very high but distribution of an additional kW of electricity is very much lower in comparison.
o Often the whole market is only able to support a single firm as the AC will be substantially higher if the market share was divided (illustrate with diagram).
o Therefore, only 1 single firm tend to serve the entire market and it therefore has substantial market power. (Illustrate with diagram the profit max P and Q.
Example 2
 Artificial barriers -- legal
o Artificialbarriersthroughlicencingorpatentswhichareusuallygivenonlytoveryfew firms or 1 firm in the case of patents confer high market power on firms. As the license is granted to only a few firms or 1 firm, the firm with the license or patent will be able to enjoy exclusive right to the market.

 For example, Singtel was the sole fixed line telephone services provider before the telecommunication sector was liberalized.
o This prevented new firms entering the industry and therefore created a very inelastic demand for Singtel due to a lack of substitutes available as Singtel has complete market share.Conferring SingTel with high market power.
BTE like intellectual property rights and patents can help firm to confer more market power. Firms are unable to join a particular industry as they do not have the technology or patents and is thus unable to free ride on that of the others, e.g. Apple’s distinctive touch screen capabilities enables it to gain a strong market share in the global electronics market with its IPhone, IPAD. Its competitors, like Creative Z110 and Blackberry, have seen a fall in market share as it is unable to compete due to its limited technology and thus leading to Apple acquiring more market power.
Strategic Entry Deterrence
Strategic entry deterrence are used by the incumbent firms to prevent entry of new firms and even drive out the other marginal existing firms in the industry. Strategic entry deterrence, like product recognition and product complexity, is used to confer more market power. The firm may engage in a lot of advertising which raises the fixed cost and it would be hard to compete with the incumbent as the very high cost discourages potential entrants. Product complexity in terms of after sales services is provided and developed e.g. BMW and Mercedes engage in a lot of advertising and extensive services. The costs of developing the brand name and dealer network may be substantive and this acts as an effective deterrent for new entrants to the market. Hence the market power they had is much more than their rivals like Kia and Toyota.
Conclusion
High barrier to entry makes it difficult for new firms to enter the industry and as a result of a lack of substitutes lead to an inelastic demand for firms. The inelastic demand allows firms the ability to restrict output in order to raise prices without losing significant market share.",,
b. Discuss whether greater competition should be introduced into markets in Singapore. [15m],"Approach
The discussion on whether greater competition should be introduced into markets in Singapore should be done using a TAS framework. The thesis on why/how greater competition should be introduced should focus on the benefits of having greater competition. The anti-thesis will focus on the cost of having greater competition. The benefits and costs to be discussed will be the respective impact on consumers, producers, society, discussion can be in terms of prices/consumer surplus, profits/producer surplus, choices/variety, quality (in terms of innovation/R&D), efficiency/welfare loss and equity (issues such as employment, economic growth or SOL can be considered but will be difficult to be conclusive). It is important to note that it is difficult (almost impossible) to have a synthesis or an overall conclusion remark on whether greater competition is indeed good for Singapore on the whole as the costs and benefits in the various industries could be very different due to differences in the nature of the industry (e.g. nature of product, size of market, EOS, importance of technological advancement). What is more manageable and definitely expected from candidates is an assessment of whether greater competition is indeed good in the respective markets or sectors in Singapore (e.g. public transport, primary health care, broadband provision, banking, F&B, retail, manufacturing, construction etc). A clear analysis of the benefits and costs of greater competition and an application of the analysis, to at least 2 distinct examples, and a conclusion/synthesis is required.
Introduction
Having greater competition means allowing more firms to enter the industry. This increases the level of competition amongst firms and tends to result in a loss of market share/power in existing firms. Greater competition has impact on consumers, producers and society on a whole and these impact can be analysed based on the impact on prices/consumer surplus, profits/producer surplus, choices/variety, quality (in terms of innovation/R&D), efficiency/welfare loss and equity.
Examples of increasing competition in markets may include the outcome of pro-market government policy such as liberalization, deregulation etc. The impetus could be to encourage Singaporean firms to be more efficient, be able to compete more effectively with foreign competition or prevent the exploitation of consumers.
Thesis (Greater competition in Singapore markets is beneficial) Effects on consumers:
Lower prices
The introduction of greater competition into the Singapore marketsreduces market power amongst firmsprice elasticity of demand increases (potential weakening of market power) ability to charge high prices come downlower pricesincreasing consumer’s surplus (assume the quantity consumed is the same).
E.g. liberalization of the Telco industry with the entry of M1 and Starhub has led to lower of prices of mobile plans)
The introduction of competition also reduces the occurrence for X-inefficiency as there are competitors to benchmark against each other to provide good quality products/services at low costmore stringent cost-saving techniques are adopted by firms to remain competitive consumers may gain in terms of lower prices.

E.g. issuing 2 licenses to MBS and RWS to ensure that there is little room for them to be complacent, allowing SingTel to operate MioTV to prevent Starhub Cable from enjoying complete dominance in the cable TV market
More variety/choices
The introduction of greater competition  firms to be more dynamic and responsive to consumers’ needsbetter, more innovative services, more promotional offersconsumers enjoying a wider variety and quality of products or services.
E.g. Telcos (number portability, wide network or costumer service centres, more VAS), liberalisation of the Singapore-KL route to allow more airlines to operate has increased the options available to passengers as they are not restricted to SIA or MAS flights.
Effects on Society:
Allocative efficiency
As explained earlier, greater competitionreduced market powerreduced ability to restrict output to increase pricesociety moving closing to the allocative efficient output.
Equity
The reduction in the supernormal profits earned by the firms  more equitable income distribution between the consumers and producers
Anti-thesis (Greater competition in Singapore markets is not beneficial)
Effects on consumers
Higher prices
With greater competition  firms may engage in promotional efforts (e.g. advertising, trying to secure the distribution rights) in order to increase the market share or improve their attractiveness to consumershowever competitors will also engage in similar efforts increase in promotional cost without any significant increase in market share  firms will increase price as a result of rising cost of production  consumers will face higher prices
E.g. Starhub and SingTel trying to out-bid each other for the rights to telecast soccer matches and consumers suffer a higher price as a result, consumers pay higher prices as a result of firms paying big sums of money to celebrities to endorse their product.
The relatively small market in Singapore may only be able to accommodate a small number of firms. With the entry of more firms into the market  each firm will have a smaller market share less scope for large scale productioninability to reap substantial internal EOShigher cost of production  firms may transfer the higher cost of production to consumers
Less R&D/innovation
Firms require ability and incentive to do R&D. Therefore, greater competition  reduction in protection  reduction in incentive to do R&D. Also, if greater competition leads to lesser profits, there will also be a reduction in the ability to do R&D.  consumers may suffer due to a lack of efforts in R&D/innovation.
Effects on producers
Lower profits

With greater competitionfirms lose some market power and ability to set higher prices market share is reduced and the price they can charge is reduced  lower sales revenue.
Also, greater competitionincrease in promotional activitiesincrease in cost of production. Therefore, the reduced revenue coupled with an increase in cost of production results in reduced profits for the producers.
The relatively small market in Singapore may only be able to accommodate a small number of firms. With the entry of more firms into the market  each firm will have a smaller market share less scope for large scale productioninability to reap substantial internal EOShigher cost of productionreduce profits
Evaluation
We can see from our discussion that greater competition in the Telco industry is largely beneficial for the society as the competition amongst SingTel, Starhub and M1 ensured that prices are kept low and competitive. The 3 firms also compete amongst themselves to provide good quality customer care and value-added services. Consumers are able to benefit and society move closer towards more efficiency in the distribution of resources and equity in income distribution. Although it may seem the producers do not benefit from the reduction in profits. However, the greater competition has forced them to become more efficient and as a result they are now able to compete better in the face of foreign competition.
It was slightly different in the banking sector when reduced competition amongst the local banks was encouraged with the mergers of several banks into 3 larger ones (DBS, OCBC and UOB). The merger of the local banks allowed them to be able to exploit more EOS as the increase market share allowed the banks to increase production. These EOS includes R&D, firm EOS etc (e.g. ebanking, investment in sophisticated systems). Consumers were able to enjoy lower prices and better products as a result of the reduction in competition. This also resulted in the banks becoming more competitive to be able to cope with foreign competition when they were introduced into Singapore. Now, consumers enjoy even more due to the increased competition when the foreign banks were allowed to set up their operations in Singapore.
The media industry was one where greater competition was not beneficial due to the limited size of the domestic market. When Mediaworks was formed to inject competition into the market, the result was wasteful competition and duplication of resources. The cost of production was raised as artistes and production crew had more bargaining chips in asking for higher wages. Advertisers were also able to bargain the price they have to pay for advertisement airtime. As a result, profits fell and the two firms merged eventually. A similar result is expected in the public transport (e.g. MRT) where it will be wasteful if 2 different companies operated and served the same route.
Conclusion
Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that greater competition is indeed good for Singapore. There are industries whose characteristics favoured more competition, especially those which face competition from foreign firms. Those industries which generally are not conducive for reduction in competition are those such as public transport and media, utilities etc",,
Consider different forms of market failure in Singapore and evaluate their significance for the efficient working of the economy. [25],"
Approach
Different types of market failure: market power, externalities, ignorance and asymmetric knowledge, principal-agent problems and moral hazard, should each receive attention. The first three of these can reasonably expect to gain the lion’s share of the marks. (Answers that treat inequality of income as a further source market failure should also receive credit if the argument supporting inequality is well presented. Full marks can be attained without this approach.)
Assertion of the levels of significance of different failures will only reach modest marks. An argument is expected about why these phenomena are market failure at all, and then about the level of significance they have in Singapore.
Brief Outline
First a general definition and explanation of market failure as the inability of markets to clear where MSC = MSB, the socially optimum (efficient) level of output.
Then either an overview of the variety of forms that market failure can take, with some attempt at categorising its forms either by type – market power, externalities, etc, or by effect – under- provision of public goods, merit goods, goods provided monopolistically, or in markets with asymmetric information; overprovision of demerit goods and in some cases because of moral hazard. This should be followed by detailed examination of each illustration and an attempt to assess its significance...
Or straight into a case by case examination of the particular instances of market failure in some detail but with observations about how the underlying reasons for the cases differ from each other and (as above) an attempt to assess the significance of each.
A concluding broader evaluation of the significance of each failure in the Singapore context, probably with some attempt at ranking (but this is not necessary if the differing significance has already been made clear).",,
"Singapore’s real GDP growth was 13.9% and current account surplus growth was 32.8% in 2010.
a) Explain why real GDP and current account balance are indicators of living standards
in Singapore. (8)","Approach
Define real GDP, current account balance and standard of living. Explain the use of real GDP per head as the key indicator of standard of living. Explain the great importance of trade to the Singapore economy. Since GDP = C+I+G+(X-M) the size of NX as a percentage of GDP is of significance for Singapore.
However, both are indicators only of the material welfare of the people. To have an indication of the quality of life, there must be other indicators.
Brief Outline
Define standard of living -- the material and non-material welfare of an individual or household.
Real GDP
Define Real GDP -- the value of final goods and services produced within the country during a period of time usually a year after discounting for inflation.
It is a measure of Singapore’s economic activity or output performance. It can indicate material welfare of an individual.
Real GDP divided by the appropriate population gives real GDP per capita. Real GDP per capita is a key measure of the average living standards in Singapore. The strong growth in Real GDP means Singapore is producing more output domestically. It indicates higher income per head, the people can consume more final goods and services and thus improved (material) standard of living. When the economic pie gets bigger, it will facilitate redistribution of incomes. Whereas a contraction of real GDP figure indicates that the Singapore economy has shrunk (e.g.2009-Singapore went into a recession) and the people are worse off, having lower per capita income.
Current account balance
The current account balance is divided into 2 main items: visible balance and invisible balance. Singapore is a small and open economy which is strategically located. The nature of the economy compels it to be trade driven. Total trade makes up more than 300 percent of GDP and net exports about 30% of GDP. GDP=C+I+G+(X-M). Thus, any changes in the current account balance have great bearing on the country’s real GDP.
It is important for Singapore to continue having a current account surplus as export is the largest component of GDP. When Singapore records a strong current account, its GDP expands boosted by export revenue. (given that GDP=C+I+G+X-M).There will be more income for the people, more consumption and a higher living standards. This is also an indication that the country is not spending beyond its means.
However, there should be other indicators on nonmaterial welfare. Some examples are UN’s Human Development Index and MEW to have a more accurate measure of living standards.",,
"Discuss the most appropriate policies that a government could adopt to achieve
sustained economic growth. (17)","Approach
The focus of the question is the choice of the most appropriate policies on achieving the macroeconomic goal of sustained economic growth. Discussion on appropriateness will include that of effectiveness and suitability. For actual growth to be sustained in the long-run, there must also be increase in potential output. Discuss the mechanism, suitability and the effectiveness of demand-side and supply-side policies in achieving actual and potential growth. Discuss how well each policy works and their limitations given the different nature and the current state of the economies. Use country examples to illustrate.
Brief Outline
Define actual and potential growth. To have sustained economic growth, there must be potential growth.
Explain how policies bring about actual growth work.
1) Expansionary fiscal policy to raise AD
Involves raising government expenditure and/or reducing taxes to increase AD and leading to a multiple rise in NY.
Consider the appropriateness of the policy.
Less effective for small and open economies like Singapore where G, domestic C and I are small relative to X. The extent of change in AD is therefore smaller. Also, there is a weak multiplier effect due to high leakages because of high MPS and/or MPM. Whereas for large economies like the United States fiscal policy is much more effective in stimulating economic growth as it has a large proportion of G and domestic C, I relative to X and a large multiplier. As such, Singapore uses fiscal policy to deliver supply-side initiatives to promote potential growth. For example during the 2009 Financial Crisis.
In a recession, fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy in stimulating growth as government spending is a direct injection into the economy and it can be targeted. But then again there are other limitations like time-lag and crowding out effect. Also in a recession, large tax cuts may not bring about huge private investment if business expectations are poor.
2) Expansionary monetary policy to raise AD

Involves increasing money supply or lowering interest rate to encourage C and I thus increasing AD.
Consider the appropriateness of the policy
Such a policy is ineffective for a small and open economy like Singapore which is an interest rate taker. Whereas for large economies, monetary policy is more appropriate given a large domestic economy.
In a recession, due to low consumer and business confidence, C and I may not increase with fall in interest rate. Thus, fiscal policy is more effective. But a decreased interest rate will allow the government to borrow to finance a deficit budget. Thus, expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in a recession can well complement one another.
3. Exchange Rate policy
Depreciation will cause exports to be cheaper in foreign currency and imports more expensive in domestic currency. Assuming Marshall-Lerner Condition holds, (X-M) rise leading to actual growth.
Consider the appropriateness of the policy
During weak economic climate, the exchange rate can be weakened to stimulate exports. But it has its limitations especially for small, open and export-driven economies as it causes cost-push inflation and may encourage competitive depreciation, leading to negative feedback effects. Thus, the use of exchange rate policy to stimulate actual growth is limited in such economies. Preventing the currency from strengthening to promote exports has been successful in China. If there is a global recession, such a policy is ineffective as global demand is low.
4. Trade Policy
The support of freer trade will expand export markets allowing for production on a large scale and goods becoming more price competitive. E.g. signing of FTAs
This is of importance for economies with small domestic markets and which are resource scarce, for example Singapore. These economies are dependent on both imports and exports. The increase in the current account surplus will boost actual growth. However, some countries may also turn to protectionism during weak economic climate which makes it difficult to reap the benefits from free trade policy.
Supply-side policies to boost potential growth (rightward shift of LRAS)
Once the economy attains full employment, further increase in real output can only occur if there is a rise in productive capacity in the economy (potential growth). To have sustained economic growth, there must be potential growth which is promoted with supply-side policies. They can be market-oriented or direct interventionist. The range of supply-side policies are privatization, deregulation, liberalisation, weaken trade unions, reduction of tax rates, government providing or subsidising training programmes, government fund/subsidies R&D, reduction of personal tax rates, building of infrastructure etc. But such policies may have long gestation period and may be a financial burden on the government.
Consider the appropriateness of the policy.
Supply-side policies are paramount and ongoing for all economies aspiring for sustained growth. But supply-side policies may be more effective in bringing about sustained growth for small and open economies given the limitations of demand management policies.

To have sustained actual growth there must be potential growth. Once an economy reaches full employment, the productive capacity has to be increased to allow for further actual output to increase. Supply-side policies targeting the increase in potential output is ongoing for all economies. Demand side policies targets actual growth. Which policies work best will very much depend on the current state of the economy and the nature of the economy. For small and open economies, demand-side policies like the conventional monetary and fiscal policies may be inappropriate or less effective. Such economies use supply-side policies more actively to achieve economic growth. In a recession, fiscal policy can be more appropriate than expansionary monetary policy. The latter works well in an inflationary situation. To achieve sustained growth, countries will usually use a mix of policies.",,

In 2010, the total trade deficit in the US was US$497.9 billion, an increase from the US$375 billion trade deficit of 2009.

a) Explain the possible causes of the trade deficit in the US. [10]","a) Approach
Explain what is meant by trade deficit and explain at least 3 possible causes for the US trade deficit. Answers need to consider the characteristics of the US economy and its economic situation in recent years e.g. loss in comparative advantage, the global economic recession, deterioration in the quality of the goods, etc.
The reasons should clearly show how exports revenue may fall/increase less than imports expenditure. Need to include the assumption of price elasticity of demand for X and M wherever applicable.",,
"To what extent does the nature of the US economy influence policy
recommendations to tackle the worsening trade deficit? [15]","b) Approach
 Candidates need to explain briefly the various policy tools (i.e. expenditure reducing,
expenditure switching, supply-side) that the US government has at its disposal to address its worsening trade deficit. (A detailed explanation of the workings of each policy is NOT required)
 The main focus of the essay should be on the policy recommendations. Justify that the suitability and effectiveness of these policies depend on the characteristics of the US economy (e.g. dependant on its large domestic market and capital for growth, size of its multiplier, the areas of its comparative advantage, households/govt’s attitude towards consumption and savings, great influence in the global financial market, strong dependence on the confidence in US currency, huge and sustained fiscal deficit etc.)
 While the effectiveness of the policies is largely influenced by the above, US policy makers need to consider other situations/conditions, (other factors not confined to the nature of the US economy) that may limit/improve the workings of the policies (i.e. the inherent problems in the policies – time lags, inefficiencies, the impact of the global recession, trading partners’ trade policies, etc).
 Policy recommendations should also be based on the underlying reasons of the worsening trade deficit in US. If policies implemented do not ‘match’ the actual cause of the worsening deficit, not only will it worsen the deficit, there could be other unintended consequences on the economy.
 Students then have to make a judgement as to whether the characteristics of the US economy play a significant role in determining the appropriate policies to recommend.
Suggested outline:
Intro:
Describe the nature of the US economy:
 Dependant on its relatively large domestic market and capital for growth
 Domestic firms contribute a large percentage of its GDP and employment
 US is a major trading partner for most countries
 Comparative advantage lies in capital intensive production and services.
 Besides its large trade deficit, US also has a very large budget deficit which forces
the government to borrow for its public sector spending. Body:
Thesis: (Nature of the US economy influences policy recommendation)
Explain briefly the policies that can be used to tackle US trade deficit.

(I) Expenditure reducing policies:
Explain that contractionary FP or MP may be suitable because of the nature of the US economy:
1) large proportion of its C and I relative to its GDP/external demand. A fall in C and I will
have a great impact on AE and income which in turns decreases the consumption of M.
2) low savings and large domestic C which affects the size of its downward multiplier
Evaluation:
 However, US households’ consumerism behaviour may limit the effectiveness of this
policy. When income falls, the level of precautionary savings may not rise by much and households may continue to spend. This may be worsened by the current low i/r that US banks offer.
 Since US is a major trading partner for a lot of countries, reducing its imports expenditure may cause a large fall in the exports revenue of other countries. These other countries may in turn demand less of US exports, worsening the trade deficit.
(II) Expenditure switching policies
(1) Devaluation of the currency
This policy is not available to the US government. Due to the bigger reliance on its domestic market (as compared to its external sector) and the ability to control its i/r independently, the US Federal Reserve Bank has chosen to control its money supply to influence its interest rates instead of the external value of its currency. Therefore it has adopted a floating exchange rate system.
(2) Protectionism
Protectionism is the main policy tool that the US government has used to tackle its trade deficit. Protectionism is suitable because domestic firms’ contribution to its GDP is very large and there may be a need to protect those industries that have lost comparative advantage esp. those involved in the lower end of the production chain or labour intensive industries.
Evaluation:
 Due to its large presence in the global market, protectionism may also invite retaliation
from its trading partners in the form of similar protectionistic measures. This move may spiral into a trade war.
(III) Supply side policies:
Supply side policies can be implemented to improve exports competitiveness (both price and non-price) by improving quality and productivity.
1) In order to improve the quality of US exports →employ higher level of technology and increase automation.
2) Increase in exports competitiveness can also be achieved through higher level of productivity. Government spending on education facilities, retraining programmes may develop a better skilled workforce. Such spending will help to improve the productive capacity and put downward pressure on cost-push inflation.
Evaluation:
 The outcome of such government spending may not be certain as not all firms would

be able adopt these new methods of production.
 Also, these new production methods would displace a certain degree of lower skilled
workers and these workers would find it difficult to find new work as they may not have suitable skills required by these industries. This may increase structural unemployment for the country and worsens the overall unemployment rate in view of the recession.
 Spending on the R&D sector and retraining programmes can be very costly and it takes a very long time before the intended outcome is seen. As the US government has a large budget deficit, it may not be able to spend much on these areas. It may have to borrow even more and borrowing may result in crowding out effect (this may not be very significant in a recession as the other sectors in the economy may not borrow very much) and causes a burden on the future American generation. Anti-thesis: (Other factors that influence policy recommendation)
1) Inherent problem of each of the policies
 Fiscal Policy – Govt spending may be inflexible in the SR, difficult to reduce G.
 Monetary policy – C and I may be i/r insensitive
 Protectionism distorts comparative advantage and increases inefficiency. Results in
misallocation of resources since the inefficient producers are protected from foreign
competition.
 Supply side policy – costly, long gestation period
2) Need to consider that US is currently in a recession, expenditure reducing policies may be ineffective as it will deflate the economy further and worsens the problem of unemployment.
3) Trading partners’ protectionism policies may negate the effect of US supply side policies that aim improve its exports competitiveness. In this case US may consider signing FTAs to eliminate some of these trade barriers.
4) The suitability of the policies is also dependent on whether the US government is able to diagnose the main cause of the worsening trade deficit correctly. If the worsening trade deficit is due to high level of M consumption, then expenditure reducing policies would be suitable but if it is due to lack in X competitiveness, then expenditure switching or supply side policies should be implemented instead. A misdiagnose of the problem may result in choosing the wrong policy and in turn may cause an adverse impact on the economy.
Conclusion:
In general, the policies that are available for the US government to tackle its worsening trade deficit have mostly depended on the nature of the US economy. For example expenditure reducing polices should have a great impact on consumption of imports due to the large size of the US multiplier but consumers’ behaviour towards savings may weaken the impact of this policy. Supply side policies on the other hand helps to improve the quality of exports and considered as apt and timely considering that US has lost comparative advantage in certain production. However, the government’s large budget deficit will limit some of its spending in improving areas in productivity. There are also other factors that may influence the policy choice of the US government. Expenditure reducing policies may not be suitable in view of the current US recession and unemployment problems. Protectionism has been the main policy used to reduce US trade deficit especially in reducing the trade deficit with developing countries such as China. This policy however goes against the true nature of the US economy as its implementation is not in line with the country’s comparative advantage. In assessing the suitability of the policies, it is also important for the US government to know the main cause of its trade deficit problem. This could be the first criteria for policy consideration before examining the nature of the US economy.

"Globalisation of trade and investment can raise global output. Unfortunately, the impact on prosperity both between and within different countries is very variable, with some groups suffering an absolute decline in incomes.
Examine the claim that globalisation whilst beneficial overall has adverse economic consequences for certain firms and households. [25]","Approach:
 This question focuses on material and non-material benefits / costs related to globalisation. Reference must be made to selected micro / macro objectives related to globalisation. Eg: economic growth, unemployment, efficiency and equity as these will have impacts on firms / households
 In discussing the benefits of globalisation, some issues that could be raised include global output, higher consumption possibilities, choices, EOS, rising income. In the case of adverse consequences of globalisation, issues include rising income inequity, structural unemployment and negative externalities
 The essay should discuss issues related to
o thecountry/countriesasawhole
o different extent of gains made by different countries (eg: LDCs vs DCs)
o different extent of gains made by different sectors within the country eg industries
with CA vs those without, skilled vs unskilled workers
 As the question calls for impacts on firms and households, hence explicit links must be
made to them. Concepts related to
o Firms:revenue,costs,profits,efficiency,marketshareandproducersurplus
o Households include a) providers of factors of production; and b) consumers:
price, choice, wages, consumer surplus
 Use of contrasting country examples is important in this essay to enhance the quality of
discussion.

- Explain the meaning of globalisation and how it brings about reorganization of production, trade and the integration of financial markets. For example, with the lowering of transport costs and communication costs, barriers to movement of goods and services, labour, and capital are lowered.
- Explain the benefits to countries that are engaged in globalisation:
 Explain that with freer movement of goods and services, countries could
specialise and trade in goods in which they have comparative advantage, that is, those in which they could produce at lower opportunity costs according to differences in their factor endowments. [Give contrasting examples of countries with an abundance in unskilled labour [China?] and capital/technology/expertise [USA? Japan? Germany?], and the goods they would specialize in, Highlight the benefits:
Micro concepts:
 More consumption possibilities [beyond their PPC] given that resources
are more efficiently utilized. Quantity increases, prices fall, increasing households’ material welfare. Trade is not limited to countries with differing factor endowments. Countries with similar factor endowments such as Japan and Germany also trade with each other in goods such as cars, giving households more variety too. [intra-trade]
 Firms will see larger markets for their products, TR increases. EOS reaped due to larger global markethigher revenue, increase productive and allocative efficiency, lowers unit cost  more profits for firms
 Cost is further lowered outsourcing the more labour intensive production processes [such as simple assembly and call centres] by firms (from DCs) to LDCs  lower unit costs and higher profits for firms as the wages in China and India are relatively lower.
 When these cost savings are passed onto consumers, households enjoy lower prices and higher material welfare.
 Faced with more global competition, firms would also have to be more efficient to maintain their price and non-price competitiveness. This again would benefit households in terms of production quality, variety as well as prices.
 Specialisation according to different factor endowments meant that DCs which are likely to be endowed with skilled workers in capital / knowledge based industries or capital owners will benefit from greater production. Similarly, LDCs’ CA in labour intensive products and the lower-end manufacturing sector will gain due to higher employment for lower-skilled workers and hence income for them
 FDI are likely to rise in DCs / LDCs based on the countries’ factor endowmentsthe above group of workers will further reap the gains from these investments. In addition, rise in Irise in ADrise in actual EG
Macro Ideas
 Export revenue for both DCs and LDCs would increase. Countries can
also expect an increase in FDI. This increase in AD, this would lead to more real economic growth and employment opportunities, increasing the
 
material welfare of households, especially those who are in sectors in which the countries have comparative advantage.
 An increased flow of FDI and technology, and unrestricted access to markets in DCs will benefit LDCs to a greater extent and help them move up to higher value added sectors and catch up with the DCs. The higher productivity means LDCs enjoy increasing productive capacity and can potentially earn higher income and greater consumption ( rise in AD & ASrise in EG)
- Explain the adverse consequences to countries that are engaged in globalisation:
[Note: It would be good if candidates can highlight that DCs and LDCs face different problems]
 Structural unemployment – this is likely to affect the DCs more than LDCs. This could be due to: a) Globalization exposing firms in DCs, esp those in more labour intensive sectors such as manufacturing [e.g. tyres and steel in the USA] to competition from low cost countries such as China and India. b) Outsourcing: This means that workers in certain industries eg production workers in manufacturing industry in the US and service-sector workers in industries where the business processes have been outsourced like IT software design or auditing may be unemployed. c) influx of cheap labour displacing local blue-collar workers. The demand for low-skilled workers would fall. Furthermore, theseworkers may have difficulty acquiring relevant skills to move up to higher value added sectors such as finance, biotechnology etc in which DCs enjoy CA.
 Income inequality [this follows naturally from structural unemployment]
This problem is likely to apply more to DCs. Given that DCs specialize in high- end goods, skilled workers will see a rise in demand for them. Given the inelastic supply, the income of workers in these industries will rise very fast. Eg “mind"" workers like engineers, attorneys, scientists, professors, journalists, consultants are able to compete successfully in the world market with globalization. On the other hand, unskilled workers in DCs are likely to see a fall in demand for their services, and hence a fall in wages. Worse, supply of these workers from the LDCs is increasing, depressing wages further. Hence different sectors within the
economy will see different extent of gain, leading to widening income gap.
[Not required in this question, but good to know if you want to develop this point further: The inequality may be worsened by trade unions of these industries with weak negotiating power since they now hold less power over firms that are able to easily replace workers, often for lower wages, and have the option to not offer unionized jobs anymore. Hence workers in such industries may see a decline in their income or be unemployed. However, it can also be argued that these lower- skilled workers (those in the lower / middle income groups) may potentially enjoy more from free trade. This is because they are likely to spend a larger proportion of their income on low end manufactured good eg clothes, shoes, and the like whose prices are often directly affected by free trade. On the other hand, the higher income group tends to spend more on services eg education, leisure and these are less subject to competition from abroad.]
In LDCs, the income gap could arise due to geographical immobility. Most industries are found along the coastal / urban areas due to better transport and

infrastructure facilities [e.g eastern coastal states in China vs the western ones]. Globalisation implies that production is like to take place in these places leading to increasing income disparities between urban and rural areas.
 Negative externalities experience by LDCs due to weak policing of its resources. Households / firms who are not involved in the production / consumption of these products may incur external cost like healthcare or lower productivity of its workers due to pollution or depletion of its resourcesworsen non-material SOL. Examples: China has the most polluted cities in the world. Amazon forests in Brazil are cut down to make way for urbanization. Excessive dependence on primary sectors as seen fast depletion of natural resources in Russia and Brunei.
 Exploitation of child labour: In many LDCs, globalization will result in MNCs utilizing workers to take advantage of the lower wage rates. This could mean exploitation of child labour with low pay. An example is the use of sweat shops by sports shoe manufacturers like Nike. The factories are often set up in these countries where employees agree to work for lower wages than would be required in DCs. However, one could argue if this is really exploitation. Will these workers be better off without globalization? Or is the lower wage rate offered a reflection of the country’s CA?
 Nature of products exported: the main export of LDCs is usually agricultural goods which are income inelastic. On the other hand, DCs exports mainly manufactured goods which are income elastic to the LDCs. Given rising income over time, this means that DCs are likely to see a faster rise in demand for their goods than LDCs. This translates into faster increase in revenue for firms in DCs than in LDCs
 Assumptions of CA principle: it assumes fair trade ie no dumping etc so that all will benefit from the higher trade volume. However, in reality, this is not true and LDCs are often accused of dumping their goods to markets in DCs. Like the issue on child exploitation, is it a question that LDCs possess CA in these areas or is it a manipulation of currencies ( eg China). However, when DCs dumped its products to LDCs, it is usually not due to CA.
 Volatility: the close interconnectedness due to globalisation implies that any crisis in one country may have adverse impacts on others. Eg: collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the U.S. led to a global financial crisis and recession in other countries, especially those very reliant on external demand such as Singapore. Such unpredictability can reduce a country’s long term growth
Conclusion
In the long run, globalization is an important determinant of long run growth and rising living standards and arguably benefits would outweigh the costs arguably for most nations For example, globalization has played an indispensable role in lifting many people in emerging developing countries such as China and India out of poverty. However, the gains and costs ,maybe unequally distributed between different countries and between different firms and households in a particular country. Furthermore, not all countries stand to gain from globalization. For example, while the African countries, have a lot of potential to gain from trade, they continue to be undeveloped and poor largely due to corruption and weak institutions. The role of governments is therefore critical. Through policies such as retraining, transfer payments, strengthening environmental and labour regulations, as well as R&D to identify and develop potential areas of CA, the government could help in minimizing the adverse consequences and maximize the full benefits of globalization. These

policies would also go a long way in ensuring a more equitable distribution of the benefits between different parties.",,
Explain why sales volume of electric cars increases despite the rise in material cost. [10] ,"Question Approach:
This question tests on the demand and supply factors to explain why sales volume of electric cars increase despite rising material cost. Besides demand and supply factors, there can be application of elasticity concepts such as PES and XED.
Suggested Answer:
Introduction (Explain impact of rising material cost on Qty):
● Sales volume of electric cars is also known as equilibrium quantity. It is determined by market forces such as demand and supply factors.
● A rise in material cost such as car body parts can lead to a higher COP of electric cars, profitability falls, producers less willing and able to produce at every price level, hence supply falls and quantity (sales volume) of electric cars will decrease, ceteris paribus.
● However, there are other demand and supply factors changes that will lead to increase in quantity of electric car (sales volume of electric cars).
Body Paragraph 1: Increase in demand

● As mentioned in the preamble, factors like high prices of petrol and more awareness that electric cars generally emit lesser pollution during its usage compared to petrol cars lead to a change in taste and preferences towards electric cars. Since petrol cars required the use of petrol to keep these cars moving, with the rise in petrol prices, it will lead to an increase overall cost to own a petrol car and also more pollutive when driven around, car owners might prefer switching over to electric cars that are more environmentally friendly and not subjected to immediate changes in petrol prices. Demand for electric car is likely to increase. The demand curve shifts rightwards from D1 to D1, Qty increases.
Body Paragraph 2: Increase in supply
● Overall supply of electric cars is likely to increase despite rising cop.
● Due to improvement in technology such as better lithium-ion batteries and more energy
efficient car batteries with breakthrough in research and development for electric cars producers find it profitable producers are more willing and able to supply at all price levels supply for electric car is likely to increase. The supply curve shifts rightwards from S0 to S1, Qty increases.
● Furthermore, there could be an increase in number of sellers and expansion of the electric car market besides Tesla, Hyundai, more petrol car companies such as Ford, Volkswagen and Nio are also expanding into the electric car market, hence increasing the number of sellers now with more producers are willing and able to supply at all price levels supply for electric car is likely to increase. The supply curve shifts rightwards from S0 to S1, Qty increases.

Body Paragraph 3: Simultaneous DD SS shift
● Considering that there is an increase in demand and other factors that will increase and decrease supply simultaneously, Qty is indeterminate and the outcome of qty is dependent on direction and relative extent of shift.
● Supply is likely to overall still increase as rising material cost such as more costly car body parts does not contribute largely to the overall cost of production of an electric car. The largest component of cost of production lies on the lithium-ion batteries where its cost has drastically decreases which also encourage more car companies that solely sell petrol cars to also venture into electric car market. Overall, leading to supply of electric car increases.
   
● Demand increases and supply increases, overall equilibrium quantity of electric car will increase despite rising cost of materials.
As seen from the diagram above, the increase in demand and an increase in supply leads to a reinforced increase in quantity of electric car.
Body Paragraph 3: Cross elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply
● While the demand increase and supply increase could contribute to rise in sales volume of electric cars due to the reinforced effect, XED and PES concepts could be used to explain why quantity increase despite rising material cost.
● The cross elasticity demand for electric car with petrol car is positive and likely to be XED>1, which shows that they are relatively close substitutes as both petrol cars and electric cars are able to satisfy the same wants of the consumers by being comfortable form of transportation to consumers destinations without any much differences. Hence when prices of petrol cars increase, it will lead to more consumers are switching over to electric cars, it will lead to a more than proportionate increase in demand for electric cars, leading to rightward shift of demand and thus sales volume of electric cars will increase more than proportionately.
● The supply of electric car is also relatively price elastic due to the development of technology and streamline of the production process that speeds up the production time for electric cars as it take lesser time to produce. Thus with any increase in price of electric car due to a fall in supply (such as rising material costs), it will lead to a more than proportionate increase in quantity supplied as car producers are able to respond quickly to the changes in prices.
● Therefore, with demand for electric cars is close substitute for petrol cars and supply being price elastic, it can also lead to an increase in sales volume of electric car.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a rise in demand, coupled with an overall increase in supply despite rising material cost are the main reasons behind the increase sales volume of electric cars. In addition, electric car being a close substitute to petrol cars where its XED is>1 and its supply being relatively price elastic will allow producers respond quickly to any increase in prices of electric car sale volume to increases.",,
Discuss whether providing subsidies is the best way to further increase sales volume of electric cars. [15] ,"Question Approach:
This question tests on subsidies works to increase sales volume of electric cars and compare it with other ways that government could use to increase adoption of electric cars by consumers. Students have to decide on the criteria to determine which is the best way to further increase sales of electric cars.
Suggested Answer
  
Introduction
Petrol prices kept rising and governments trying to encourage consumers to adopt electric cars over petrol cars to push for net zero carbon and achieve sustainable growth. Given electric cars emit less pollutants when used compared to petrol cars, governments would like to see increasing number of car owners to switch to electric cars. One of the ways that governments are considering adopting was to provide subsidies to improve society’s welfare. This essay seeks to discuss the ways that would further increase the sales volume of electric cars.
Body 1:
The objective of subsidy is to encourage overall consumption of electric car hence further increasing sales volume. A production subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of electric cars, but it is not made in exchange for any goods or services. Government can consider subsidizing the production of lithium-ion batteries in electric cars. When the government gives a subsidy to the producer, it will decrease the marginal cost of production. Since the supply curve is affected by the marginal cost of production, the supply will increase, shifting the supply curve rightwards from SS1 to SS2 as shown in Figure below. Due to the subsidy given, consumers benefit from the lower prices (i.e. they used to pay P1 but now pay
P2) and producers now can sell at higher quantity of Q2 instead of Q1, thus further increasing sales volume of electric cars.

For the subsidy to be effective in increasing the sales volume, the price elasticity of demand for electric cars has to be relatively price elastic. Thus, when price of electric car falls, quantity demand will increase more than proportionately leading to a significant increase in sales volume. However, when electric cars demand is price inelastic, the amount of government subsidy given has to be significantly large to have a substantial increase in sales volume.
Body 2:
(change in T& P)
Another way to increase sales volume of electric cars would be public campaigns and education to raise awareness of climate change and target car owners and educate them on the pollution level of petrol car vs electric car. These might change the taste and preferences of car owners, encouraging car owners to switch to electric cars from petrol cars. Leading to an increase in demand for cars, rightward shift of demand, under ceteris paribus condition, it will lead to further increase in sales volume of electric cars.
Limitation:
Education and campaigns are limited in its outreach as car owners might not be persuaded by just the bigger picture of climate change and being sustainable or greener as proportion of income spent on car could be large amount for some consumers, hence it might not be a large contributing factor to their choice of cars as electric cars are generally still more expensive compared to petrol cars. Mindset about consuming responsibly will take time to take effect.
Government can also consider increasing the amount of charging points and improve the infrastructure to charge electric cars such as allocating more parking spaces for electric cars or lanes dedicated to electric car, EV-ready HDB towns. These might change the taste and preferences of car owners,
 
     encouraging car owners to switch to electric cars from petrol cars. Leading to an increase in demand for cars, rightward shift of demand, under ceteris paribus condition, it will lead to further increase in sales volume of electric cars.
Limitation:
Development of charging infrastructure could be challenging in large countries with rural areas. Drivers who need to use electric cars for long distance travel, hence it might not enable consumers to switch easily to electric cars.
Overall:
Such initiatives will incur opportunity cost and divert funds away from more pressing issues may have an undesirable impact on the society welfare as a whole as electric car adoption might not be the priority of the government though it can improve standard of living due to less pollutive environment.
Body 3: (Encourage investments)
Regulation:
(Indirect way: Regulation: stricter emission targets for car producers)
Government can also encourage investments into green technology as they achieve a sustainable economic environment with net zero carbon emission to deal with climate change. Encouraging more car maker companies to also step up their research and development into creating more models of energy efficient electric cars thus increasing supply.
China imposed regulations which mandated car manufacturers to require them a certain percent of all vehicles sold by a manufacturer each year must be battery powered instead of petrol. To avoid financial penalties, every year manufacturers must earn a stipulated number of points, which are awarded for each EV produced based on a complex formula that takes into account range, energy efficiency, performance, and more. The requirements get tougher over time, with a goal of having EVs make up 40 percent of all car sales by 2030. Hence producers will need to step up production into the developing more electric vehicles, thus supply increase.
Government can use regulations such as tightening pollutant thresholds to clearly distinguish the petrol cars and cleaner alternative cars such as electric cars that are more energy efficient and less pollutive to be on the roads. This would encourage car makers to invest and step up their production of such electric cars instead of just focus on improving petrol car models. It would increase supply of electric cars and differentiating into different models such as standard or sports version.
Government regulations might be easier to implement and more cost efficient compared to subsidies. However, it also takes time for car makers improve on the efficiency of electric cars creating real differences.
Conclusion
However, which is the best way depends on the available government budget allocated towards such green and sustainable outcome. With limited amount of government budget, education and regulation that does not require large cost incurred in monitoring is better than providing subsidies to increase adoption of electric cars thereby increasing the sales volume of electric cars.
   
Furthermore, subsidies might not be translated into cheaper prices of cars where demand is relatively price inelastic for example in Singapore. As the proportion of income spent on cars is relatively large, hence, to significantly increase the adoption of electric cars in Singapore, it might not be made successful with just provision of producer subsidy, it has to be complemented with better infrastructure to support electric cars to increase the sales volume of electric cars.
The best way is to use range of ways that complement each other where the market seeks to increase sale volume of electric cars via an increase demand and supply of electric cars.",,
"2. Bubble tea lovers in Singapore have the highest spending power of US$342 annually, with the bubble tea industry earning a profit margin of around 75%. The industry has enough room for larger and smaller players to co-exist and flourish. The emergence of new players who are good at branding, supply chain and cost management could pose an increasing challenge to existing local players.
a) Explain how the market structure in which bubble tea industry operate is likely to affect the firm’s pricing and output decisions. [10]","Point
The Bubble Tea industry operates in an Oligopoly market structure and therefore the mutual interdependence characteristics in the firm results in price rigidity among the firms, affecting their pricing and output decisions.
Example
Bubble Tea firms tend to not engage in pricing competition where their main competitive strategies are non- price competition in their consistent attempt to differentiate and diversify their products.
Economic Analysis
Mutual interdependence between the firms in Oligopoly would have resulted in the firms experiencing a kinked demand curve where:
- Increase in price above P1 would be along a |PED| >1 demand curve
- Leads to a more than proportionate decrease in quantity demanded
- Fall in TR

- Decrease in price below P1 would be along a price inelastic demand curve where 0< |PED| <1
- Leads to a less than proportionate increase in quantity demanded
- Fall in TR

In addition, the presence of the disjoint MR also meant that:
- Any changes in the MC between MC1 and MC2
- There would be no changes in the P and Q where price and
output would remain at P1 and Q1.
 Link to ATQ
Given the mutual interdependence nature of the Bubble Tea firms, there is often price rigidity and firms are generally unwilling to change prices.

Point
The Bubble Tea industry operates in an Oligopoly market structure and the dominating firms in the industry tend to have differentiated products/ strong brand loyalty where 0<|PED|<1 compared to the small firms operating in the Monopolistic Competitive Market Structure.
Example
Large dominating firms in the Bubble Tea industry like Liho, Koi and Gong Cha have their own unique drinks and often the consumer loyalty results in the presence of weak substitutes allowing them to have a price inelastic demand for their products.
Economic Analysis
Ability to product differentiate:
- Weak substitutes relative to if the firms where operating in an
MC market structure where products are mostly homogenous
- Price inelastic demand (Oli)
- Poli is higher than Pmc

- Tendency to charge at a higher price level as an Oligopoly than that of a firm in MC

Link to ATQ
The level of market dominance will have an impact on the price set by the firms, when the demand for the good is more price inelastic, the price will be higher and the output will be lower.
Point
The Bubble Tea industry operates in an Oligopoly market structure where they tend to engage in non- price competition as a strategy to compete against others.
Example
The firms in the bubble tea industry frequently differentiates their product, varying in the quality and variety of their product.
E.g. Liho is known for their Cheese infused milk topping, Koi diversifies to different fruity tea dependent on season, Chi Cha San Sen who is known for the quality tea used, especially with every cup of tea made from controlled brewing technique, Playmade with their highly diverse toppings where their bubbles come in different flavours.
Economic Analysis
The output of the bubble tea industry is homogenous but highly diversified.
- Competitive environment has created the incentive to R&D
- Supernormal profits has created the ability to R&D
- Product differentiation is a common scene in the bubble
tea industry.
- Highly diverse and quality output in the bubble tea
industry.

Link to ATQ
Output in the bubble tea industry is highly diverse and of high quality and variety due to the competitive environment and frequent product differentiation.

",,
b)  Discuss the potential benefits and problems that are likely to be experienced by the consumers and producers with the entrance of new competitors. [15] ,"Point
With the entrance of new competitors, consumers would benefit more as the competition would drive down prices and improve on the quality of output.
Increase in competition:
- Increase in number of substitutes
- Demand for the bubble tea of the incumbent firms will fall since
the share of the consumer market has to be shared among more
firms
- DD0 to DD1
Consumers: Benefits
- Prices charged will be lowered (P0 to P1)
- Variety available to the consumers will be higher with more firms
around
- Quality of the Bubble Tea will improve with more product
differentiation mentioned in part a)
- E.g. Liho is known for their Cheese infused milk topping, Koi
diversifies to different fruity tea dependent on season, Chi Cha San Sen who is known for the quality tea used, especially with

every cup of tea made from controlled brewing technique, Playmade with their highly diverse toppings where their bubbles come in different flavours.
Producers: Problems
- Prices charged will be lowered (P0 to P1)
- Quantity sold lowered (Q0 to Q1)
- TR falls from (0P0AQ0 to 0P1BQ1)
- Firms might be earning lesser profits as seen in the diagram from
the original supernormal profit of C0P0AC to normal profit.

the original supernormal profit of C0P0AC to normal profit.
Link to ATQ
Higher competition is often seen to be desirable for consumers while not so for incumbent firms in the industry, however, this is also dependent on the firm’s ability to maintain the consumer market, if the demand does not fall significantly given the branding and consumer loyalty, the implications on the fall in demand would be lesser and producers’ impact via the fall in TR and Profits might be lesser.
However, like what was mentioned in the pre-amble, where new competitors are good at branding, supply chain and cost management, this could mean that the competitors could be better at meeting the taste and preferences of the consumers where the demand would fall significantly. In addition, the ability to manage supply chain and cost meant that the new firms are able to enjoy more cost savings and charge at a lower price level, increasing the quantity demanded for the BBT as well. Eventually impact on the incumbent producers

Point
Higher competition often suggests lesser ability to reap internal economies of school which is detrimental to both consumers and producers.
Example
With a lowered output, bubble tea firms in the industry might be unable to enjoy cost savings from specialization via technical economies of scale. When the production level is too low, the bubble tea firm is unable to specialise the production process and the employee might have to take order, prepare and seal the drink, henceforth unable to specialise and reap internal EOS.
Economic Analysis
Increase in number of competitors:
- Decrease in demand for specific firms due to the sharing of the
consumer market
- Decrease in Q
- Decreases in the ability to reap internal economies of scale
- Increase in average cost and the marginal cost of production
- MC0 to MC1

Consumers: Problems
- Higher Price level from P0 to P1
- Lesser quantity (Q0 to Q1)
- Fall in the consumer surplus in accordance to the firm’s
diagram (P0AC to P1AB)
Producers: Problems
- Lowered ability to reap internal EOS
- Higher AC
- Lower profits made by producers

Link to ATQ
With more competition and firms in the industry, the ability to reap internal EOS is a significant problem as the pre-amble mentioned that the new competitors are good at branding, supply chain and cost management, meaning that their cost might already be lowered. Without the ability to reap internal EOS, the incumbent firms would incur a higher cost, earn lesser profit while being unable to compete with the new firms that are more effective in their cost management.

Conclusion:
Stand
Essential, consumers tend to benefit more from the increased competition in the market while producers tend to suffer more problems from the increased competition.
Substantiat e
The extent of the problem is dependent on the ability of the firms to make its product remain demanded in the market in spite of the new competition. Example where Koi is able to maintain the consumer loyalty through the quality drinks created and service provided, even when new firms in the market like Chi Cha San Sen enters with their quality drinks, the impact on the fall in demand for Koi might be insignificance.
Suggest
Time period could be another element of discussion where in the short run, the competition might seem to be a problem for the producers who are unable to respond in time to the new competition. However, in the long run once the firms are able to respond to the new competition, the impact of the competition on the firms might not be significant.",,
" To ensure the success of vaccination as a tool in COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control, a high vaccination rate in a country is required. However, despite the vaccines being provided free of charge, vaccine hesitancy is still prevalent in some countries due to the spread of misinformation.
(a) Explain how consumers act rationally to decide whether to take the COVID-19 vaccine and the likely impact of their decisions on resource allocation in the COVID-19 vaccine market. [10]","Introduction
A rational consumer seeks to maximise his satisfaction or net benefit. In deciding whether to consume a good, the consumer will apply the marginalist principle and consider the marginal private benefit (MPB) and marginal private cost (MPC) of consuming the good. The MPB reflects consumers’ additional benefit (i.e. satisfaction or utility) from consuming the last unit of the good / service. The MPC reflects consumers’ additional cost to consume the last unit of good / service.
How consumers act rationally to decide whether to take vaccine
The consumer will take his MPB and MPC into account in deciding whether to take COVID-19 vaccine. The MPB of consuming the vaccine is the protection and savings on medical costs he enjoys due to lowered chances of falling ill after being infected with the virus and minimizing the risk of spreading the virus to his household. The MPC is the cost of vaccination incurred. Other than the explicit cost, i.e. the price of the vaccine, it also includes the opportunity cost, the next best alternative forgone in terms of other goods, e.g. food, he could have purchased with that amount of money. He could also have spent the time allotted for the vaccination on other activities like watching a movie instead.
With reference to Figure 1, if his MPB higher than MPC, at Q1, the consumer will proceed to take the vaccination. However, if his MPB is less than his MPC, at Q2, the consumer will decide not to take the vaccination. Hence, the consumer will consume up to the point where MPB = MPC at Qp. At this point, the consumer maximises his net benefit as seen by the area abc

How positive externalities can lead to under-allocation of resources
However, consumption of the vaccination generates positive externalities, which third party can enjoy (external benefit) as well. Vaccinations help prevent the spread of viruses to the community at large. Those in the community are now less likely to be infected as there is one less person who has the potential to transmit the virus. The community will benefit from saved medical expenses, and the economy benefits since less man-hours is lost to workers being ill. This external benefit is not taken into account by the consumers in their decision making as they only consider their MPB. The existence of marginal external benefit (MEB) results in a divergence between MPB and the marginal social benefit MSB as seen in the diagram above, where the MSB lies above the MPB, with the vertical distance between MPB and MSB representing MEB. The socially optimal output, 0Qs, is where MSC = MSB. Between 0Qp and 0Qs, MSB > MSC. As such, at output 0Qp, society values an additional unit of vaccination more than what it would cost society. Society desires more consumption of vaccination, hence, when the decision is left to the market, there is under-consumption of vaccination by QpQs amount or there is an under-allocation of resources. By summing the excess of MSB over MSC for the units QpQs, we arrive at a monetary measure of welfare loss (also known as deadweight loss) of area ABC to the society.

How under-valuation of MPB can lead to under-allocation of resources
In addition, due to imperfect information, consumers might not have an accurate valuation of their MPB as they are not fully aware of the benefits (to himself) of getting vaccinated as they get to avoid the potential complications caused by the viruses. Therefore, consumers may under-estimate the actual marginal private benefit (MPBactual) of getting vaccinated, resulting in a perceived marginal private benefit (MPBperceived) that is lower than MPBactual. With accurate valuation of the MPB, quantity of vaccination consumed would be at 0Qa. However, consumers are consuming at output level 0Qp. Hence, there is an under consumption of vaccination due to imperfect information and there is under-allocation of resources in the market for vaccines.

Alternatively, it is also possible to analyse that inefficient allocation of resources arises from MPCperceived being higher than MPCactual.)

Conclusion
A rational consumer would weigh his MPB against MPC in deciding whether to take the vaccine as his aim is to maximise his own net benefit. However, such a process might not generate an outcome that is socially optimal as the consumers’ valuation of his private benefit might not be accurate or does not take into the external benefit, resulting in the MPB being lower than the MSB. As a result, there is under-consumption and under-allocation of resources in the market.",,
(b)  Discuss how government intervention in the market for vaccines could lead to social welfare being maximised and consider how likely such intervention will achieve this aim. [15] ,"Introduction
As there is under-allocation of resources in the vaccine market, government intervention is required in the market to ensure that there is efficient allocation of resources so that welfare to society can be maximized.
How subsidies work to achieve efficient allocation of resources
Subsidies is a policy which could be used to tackle market failure in the vaccine market.

With reference to Figure 4, the government can provide a per-unit subsidy that is equal to the MEB at the socially optimal level of output, 0QS. The amount of per-unit subsidy is equal to the vertical distance of MEB (Distance between MSB and MPBactual) at 0QS. The subsidy provided has the same effect as decreasing the unit cost of consuming the vaccine. Thus, the subsidy shifts the consumer’s MPC vertically downwards by the full amount of the subsidy to coincide with MSC. This is illustrated by MPC - subsidy. If the subsidy is calculated to accurately reflect the MEB at 0Qs, consumers will consider the true social benefit of consuming the vaccine and increase consumption to the socially optimal level 0QS. Thus, allocative efficiency is attained.
How effective is subsidy
Subsidies aim to tackle the root cause, presence of positive externalities of under-consumption. This is because through rational decision making in the free market, producers and consumers ignore external benefits and only account for their self-interests by considering private benefits and costs. A subsidy is effective since it targets this root cause as these external benefits are internalised.

If amount of subsidy imposed is correctly estimated to reflect monetary value of MEB generated, the amount of vaccines consumed or produced in market will coincide with the socially optimal level. However, this requires an accurate estimation of the MEB. Under-valuation of MEB implies that although consumption of the vaccines is increased by the given subsidies, it is not sufficient to bring output to the socially optimal level to maximise society’s welfare. An over-valuation of the MEB implies that although output is increased, it will result in over-consumption and welfare is again not maximised. However, this does not seem to be the concern of some governments as their purpose is to encourage all those who are eligible to consume by giving full subsidization of the vaccine.
(Note:
Alternatively, it is possible to argue that MEB in this case is so large that it justifies a full subsidization by the government.)
How public education works to achieve efficient allocation of resources
However, despite full subsidization of the vaccine there are some who are still reluctant to take the vaccines. Hence, there is still a need to for the government to embark on education campaigns to correct the imperfect information in the market for the vaccines. Education campaigns are aims at making consumers more aware of the full benefits of consuming the vaccines to themselves. Hence, consumers’ perceived benefits increase to the level of actual benefits. For instance, there advertisements in different languages put up on various platforms by the Singapore government to encourage Singaporeans to take the vaccines. With public education by the government, consumers perceive the benefits of consuming the vaccines becomes higher, thus narrowing the gap between the perceived and actual benefits of vaccination.
With reference to Figure 3, if such public education campaigns are successful, the private benefit for health care services would increase from MPBperceived to MPBactual which will cause consumption to increase from Qperceived to Qactual, reducing the extent of underconsumption and reducing the extent of market failure.
How effective is public education
Education campaigns targets the root cause of imperfect information and is hence likely to be effective in reducing the extent of underconsumption. However, its effectiveness depends on receptiveness of the public to the content of the education campaigns thereby causing the outcomes from public education to be uncertain.
There could also be a possibility whereby education campaigns convinced the mass of the importance of the external benefits of healthcare services and alter their decision-making process in the long run. For instance, they could be convinced of the external benefits of ‘herd immunity’ and integrate it into their valuation of benefits. This could increase the MPB of consuming vaccination, thereby increase the equilibrium quantity of vaccination consumed to the social optimal level.

Due to the time taken to educate the mass it is likely to be more effective as a long-term preventive measure. However, given the nature of the pandemic, governments would need to boost the take-up rate of the vaccines substantially over a short period of time.
However, the effectiveness of this measure can be affected by the extent of the spread of misinformation. If it has caused a large information gap, resulting in a greater divergence between MPBactual and MPBperceived, then it is unlikely to be sufficient to addresstheissueofimperfectinformation. Insuchcases,theuseoflegislationtocurb the spread of misinformation might be necessary to ensure that the information gap can be closed, thereby reducing the extent of the deadweight loss and increasing social welfare.
How regulation works to achieve efficient allocation of resources
The government might need to implement other measures like regulation. For example, in Singapore, the government put in place a regulation that only those who are vaccinated are allowed to enter public places like the shopping malls. This is similar to vaccine passes implemented in other countries to encourage more of their citizens to get vaccinated more quickly. By doing this, it will raise MPC relative to the MPB if one does not get vaccinated or increases the MPB relative to the MPC if one gets vaccinated. This then incentivize the rational consumer to make the decision to get vaccinated after weighing their MPB against their MPC. With higher consumption of the vaccines, the output can move closer to the socially optimal level, increasing social welfare.
How effective is regulation
For regulation to be effective, strong enforcement on the part of the government is required. The necessary mechanism for monitoring and checking for compliance by the public has to be in place. There should also be stiff penalties imposed for non-compliance. Hence, the effectiveness of this policy is subjected to whether the government has sufficient resources and the ability to ensure that appropriate punishment can be meted out to those who do not comply. For countries that are able to do so will likely be able to increase consumption of the vaccine sufficiently thereby increasing social welfare.
(Note:
Alternatively, legislation to address the spread of misinformation is another example that can be used.)
Conclusion
While government intervention in the form of subsidy and public education can be implemented to address the problems of positive externalities and imperfect information, the effectiveness of these measures in achieving efficient allocation of resources are dependent on various factors, like the ability of the government to estimate to MEB and willingness of the public to change their mindset. However, timing is an important consideration in this context. Given the urgency in controlling the spread of the virus,

these measures are not sufficient and many governments adopted additional measures like regulation to boost take-up rate of the vaccines quickly.",,
"Rapid population ageing and a shrinking labour force in Japan are major challenges for achieving further increases in its living standards and ensuring the financial sustainability of its public social expenditures.
(a) Explain how Japan’s rapid ageing population affects its future economic performance.
[10]","Introduction
Population ageing in Japan has progressed more rapidly as compared to other countries. Currently, Japan has the highest old-age dependency ratio of all countries, with a ratio in 2017 over 50 persons aged 65 and over, for every 100 persons aged 20 to 64 and this ratio is projected to rise to 79 per hundred in 2050. This essay will explain the impact of Japan’s rapid ageing population on its future economic performance. Japan’s future economic performance includes the key macroeconomic objectives that are sustained economic growth, low unemployment rate, low inflation rate and favourable balance of trade (BOT).
Body I: Impact on potential economic growth

Japan’s working-age population (persons aged 15-64) has been declining trend since the late 1990s and this decline is likely to feed through a considerable decline in the total labour force over the next few decades.
With higher retirement figures and insufficient younger people entering the workforce to replace these workers, the quantity of workforce will drop further fuelling the fall in LRAS from AS0 to AS1.
Coupled with shrinking labour force, older workers may not be able to keep pace with technological changes and changing work requirements Falling labour productivity
Thus, the fall in both quantity and quality of labour would limit potential economic growth as Yf0 falls to Yf1
Fall in potential economic growth

Body II: Impact on future balance of payment & potential economic growth
However, the longer working lives could help limit the decline in Japan’s workforce and boost social security contributions to finance rising health and pension expenditures. Successful R&D that provide robotics solutions eg greater automation in manufacturing and services sector that reduce the need for physical work
rise in labour productivity and expansion of service sector
gain comparative advantage in say, robotics design and manufacturing increases in future trade surplus healthy balance of payments in future
falling cyclical unemployment as firms expand output and increase their derived demand for labour
increases potential economic growth
Body III: Impact on future price stability
In the longer run, the fall in labour force > fall in demand for labour
rise in nominal wages in future across the various labour markets
rise in the unit costs of production of all firms
firms will pass on the increase in unit cost of production to consumers

Body IV: Impact on future financial sustability
Rapid ageing population
Increase in number of retirees increase pension expenditure strain on financial sustainability of Japan’s social security system
Conclusion
Overall, the impact of Japan’s rapid ageing population on its future economic performance is likely to be adverse.",,
Discuss the economic policies which might help the Japanese government to mitigate the adverse impact of its rapidly ageing population. [15] ,"Introduction
▪ Briefly state the adverse impact of rapidly ageing population: shrinking labour force, lower labour productivity growth, reduced potential economic growth
▪ Identify the economic policies that might help mitigate the adverse impact of ageing population.
▪ Policies that could increase employment levels or rise labour productivity
▪ Comment whether the proposed economic policies could successfully mitigate the adverse impact of its ageing population
Body I: Economics policies that increase the quantity of labour
1. Further increases in employment of older labour would help to limit the steep fall in total labour force that Japanese is projected to face over the next 20-30 years.
Proposed economics policy: Extend retirement age
▪ Extend retirement age
o In the short run, the Japanese government should seek to extend
mandatary retirement age which can be phased in progressively every two years. The government can also increase the re-hiring of older

workers above age 70. Do note that the Japanese government has increased the mandatory retirement age to 70 years old in Apr 2021.
Comment: Gradually increase the mandatory retirement age as this will reduce the risk that older workers are re-hired as non-regular workers.
o In the longer term, the Japanese government should consider abolishing the mandatory retirement age altogether as done in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and United States where these countries set law to ban mandatory retirement age.
Comment:
But unless the wage systems are reformed, employers will continue to resist raising the mandatory retirement age. One of the biggest difficulties in hiring older workers arises from their high wages due to the seniority-based wage system. The seniority-based pay system rewards worker for each additional year of service. However, this makes older workers expensive relative to their productivity which creates a barrier to their continued employment.
In terms of employees’ perspectives, many older workers face a substantial pay cut following mandatory retirement and may end up being rehired in jobs that do not fully utilised their skills, which undermines their job satisfaction, motivation and well-being.
Limitations: Japan already has rates of labour force participation for older people that are among the highest of OECD countries, especially for older men. Thus, limited room to increase employment rates for older men.
2. Issues facing Japan currently:
▪ Situation of many older women who have been involved in
non-regular work at younger ages (Non-regular jobs include
part-time, temporary, dispatched, and contract workers.)
▪ Many women leave employment following marriage and child birth.
Proposed policy: Rise women labour force participation rate
▪ Boost opportunities to combine work and care for children and elderly parents in order to help women to (re-)entrer and stay longer in the workforce.
▪ Enhance the availability of high-quality childcare; reducing long working hours and increasing working-time flexibility, in part by better enforcing the Childcare and Family Care Leave Law.

Comment:
▪ Partially offset the negative effects of population ageing on the size of workforce
▪ Help to bolster incomes and pensions at older ages. This is particularly important in Japan, where relative poverty rate of people aged over 65 years is 19.6% against 12.5% on overage in the OECD.
▪ Contribute significantly to the fiscal sustainability of social security
However, poor quality jobs and working conditions undermine reforms to lengthen working lives. Excessive work hours for many Japanese workers as well as a lack of autonomy and support from colleagues.
Body II: Economics policies that boost labour productivity
▪ In view of rapid ageing population and an uncertain global economic environment, productivity-driven growth can deliver sustainable and inclusive economic development and improve Japan's standard of living over time.
▪ Define productivity: Productivity is measured by the output per worker per period of time or output per man-hour.
▪ Policies to boost labour productivity: Supply-side policy such as human capital development, tax incentives /subsidies, subsidize firms’ R&D initiatives etc
Proposed policy: Interventionist Supply-side policy – Human capital development
▪ Investment in human capital eg education
i. Investing in skills is critical to improve productivity and respond to labour market changes. Adapting and upgrading the skills of older workers as well as making the best use of their skills represent a major challenge for Japan. It would help to overcome labour shortages, increase labour productivity and ensure workers have the right skills for an increasingly digital and globalised labour market.
ii. Invest in lifelong learning to support the good foundation skills among older and younger Japanese adults and reduce inequalities in training participation by age, skill and type of employment contract.
A key determinant is the skills obtained at a younger age through education and training as well as those skills acquired through participation in further training. The learning content of jobs also has an important impact on skills development over the life cycle. Some skills

are likely to decline over age, although experience may compensate for this decline.

↑ productive capacity and potential economic growth

Comment:
With advances in technology and automation, jobs increasingly involve sophisticated tasks, require analysing and communicating information. Hence, poor proficiency in information-processing skills not only restrains employment opportunities but also limits access to many services. More than ever, lifelong learning is of key importance, for all workers in all kinds of jobs. Workers in low-technology sectors and those performing low-skilled tasks must learn to be adaptable, because they are at higher risk of losing their job, as routine tasks are increasingly performed by machines, and companies may relocate to countries with lower labour costs. In high-technology sectors, workers need to update their competencies and keep pace with rapidly changing techniques. The job prospects of older workers will be increasingly dependent on the skills they have acquired and kept up to date over their careers.
As in other developed countries, high-skilled workers in Japan tend to participate more often in work-related training than the low skilled. In general, worker who have already built up a substantial stock of human capital learn more easily and their rates of return to learning tend to be higher. Thus, the need to train workers over the whole working life cycle rests on the continuous adoption of new technologies and forms of work organisation which are changing the skills needed in jobs. Training needs are also linked to changing jobs, functions or duties within the company.
Body III: Fiscal Policy
▪ Payroll levies: Payroll levies on employers are used in some countries as a way to pool resources from employers and earmark them for expenditure on vocational training. It is expected that they help avoid the “free-riding” of some companies, stemming from the fact that some employers invest considerably in their workforce (with expected benefits for the whole economy).
Comment (Limitations):
  
 Some companies may use the funds for other activities and charge them to training. The net impact of these levies also remains unclear, as the policy may encourage employers to provide more internal training than they otherwise would have. These schemes may also not be sufficiently targeted, eg to promote training for the more disadvantaged groups, namely those with a low skill level and those who have a poor previous participation in further training. Further, if not targeted at SMEs, they are likely to benefit more large companies as these have more capacities to identify training needs of their workers and organise training.
▪ Develop further the recognition and certification system of prior learning acquired at work as well as a qualifications framework. This would help to standardise training and make it more transferable between companies for workers of all ages. A qualification framework would help achieve this and both actions should be carried out in partnership with employer and worker representatives.
▪ Set stronger incentives for employers to invest in training and to include social partners for the implementation of a lifelong learning strategy. In particular, SMEs have few resources for workforce development and lack instruments to identify their skills needs. Thus, government support for training eg subsidies, in particular of non-regular workers and targeted at SMEs should be leveraged up.
▪ Provide training in transversal skills irrespective of age. This includes investing in ICT skills as well as in soft skills for all age groups.
Comment:
One major obstacle to training over the lifecycle is that in many cases training needs are not identified. Some Japanese firms provide mid-career interviews and counselling but their focus remains on future employment and pay options after reaching a certain age instead of identifying training needs and gaps to help promote job mobility within and across firms. The government has taken several small steps in recent years to encourage firms to assess training needs of their workers including a subsidy to employers who introduce mechanisms that provide employees with opportunities for career consultations and access to certified career consultant agencies.
Body IV: Other policies
▪ Japan is promoting the establishment of career and lifelong learning counselling in companies. Practically, employers can introduce a mechanism “The Self-Career Doc system” that periodically provides employees with opportunities for various career workshops and career consultations, based on human resources development policies. In this
 

way, employees can independently promote their own career development. In Japan, certified career consultant agencies have been established since 2001.
▪ Hello Work (Japan’s Public Employment Services) provides special counselling and guidance and job replacement services for older job seekers aged 55 and above. Even with Hello Work’s help, more can be done to improve job matching and placement for this group. On one hand, older jobseekers are often steered towards occupations of low quality for which there are shortages and which younger workers show little interest. On the other hand, Hello Work counsellors find it difficult to change the negative attitude of some older jobseekers to new jobs. Hello Work could complement caseworker’s judgement with qualitative guidelines and data-intensive approaches.
Comment:
Takes time to influence mindsets and change societal norms.
Conclusion
Since each policy comes with its own set of limitations, it is critical that the Japanese government designed policies to raise the labour force participation rate for women and older workers in the short run. In the longer term, the government should design polcies to boost labour productivity.",,
"5 Global inflation has been revised upwards due to rising food and energy prices.
(a) Explain the conflicts between the government macroeconomic goals. [10]
","Introduction:
● Government aims to achieve the following 4 macroeconomic goals: High and sustainable economic growth, low inflation (price stability), low unemployment and healthy balance of payments.
● Possibleconflictsmayariseinachievingthe4macroeconomicaims.
Body:
1. Low inflation vs actual growth/low unemployment
Conflict arises when the economy aims to achieve low inflation and actual growth/unemployment. For example, as Vietnam experience growth from 6.2% to 7.0% growth and fall in unemployment from 2.33% to 2.21% from 2016 to 2018, her inflation rate increases from 2.6% to 3.5% for the same period. This is because as AD increase close to full employment from AD1 to AD 2 to AD3 as seen in Fig 1, this will lead the real national income increases from Y1 to Y2 to Y3, hence achieving actual growth in the short run. In addition, the increase in AD will also result in an increase production level as firms will need to step up production to meet the higher demand. This result in a higher need for factor of production and increase in the hiring of factor of production like labour, thus reducing the cyclical unemployment.


However, the trade off to economic growth and low unemployment is that general price level increases as AD increases close to full employment level, causing demand pull inflation. As AD increases, the economy moves closer to the full employment, thus resulting in higher competition for the depleting available resources. This pushes the price of resources up and results in firms experiencing a rising cost of production. The firms will then transfer the rising cost of production to the consumer therefore prices charged for their commodities will rise. GPL will therefore increase as real output increases. Hence, this explains for the conflict in achieving low inflation and actual growth/low unemployment.
2. Low inflation vs healthy balance of trade

When export revenue is increasing due to the increase in export demand and/or import expenditure is decreasing due to fall in import demand, this will result in an increase in net export and improving the balance of trade. However, the increase in net export will lead to the increase in AD. As AD increases as seen in figure 1, the economy moves closer to the full employment, thus resulting in higher competition for the depleting available resources. This pushes the price of resources up and results in firms experiencing a rising cost of production. The firms will then transfer the rising cost of production to the consumer therefore prices charged for their commodities will rise and GPL increase.
3. Economic growth vs low structural unemployment
Economic growth involves changes in production both in terms of the goods produced, and techniques used and the skills required. Hence the more rapid the rate of growth, the more rapid the rate of change in production techniques. People may then find their skills are no longer relevant or their jobs may be replaced by machines. Workers may thus find themselves unemployed as their skills do not match the available jobs. For instance, when the economy experience economic growth, firms are more likely to invest in machines such as self check out/in machines in retails stores or hotels, as well as technology like cashless payment technology to streamline their production process and increase productivity, these new machines and technology increases the productive capacity and LRAS of the economy, achieving economic growth. Yet at the same time, workers may not have the relevant skills to operate these new machines and technology, resulting in them being unemployed. Thus there is a mismatch of skills and opportunities as economic growth brings about a change in the structure of the economy, causing the conflict in achieving economic growth and low unemployment.
Conclusion:
In aiming to achieve the 4 macroeconomic objectives, government is likely to face the possible conflicts: low inflation vs actual growth/low unemployment, economic growth vs low structural unemployment, economic growth vs healthy BOP and low inflation vs healthy BOP. Hence, there is a need for government to implement the relevant macroeconomic policies to help achieve the macroeconomic objectives.

(b) Discuss the other factors that can influence government choice of policies to tackle the rising prices. [15],"Introduction
To tackle rising price, government can consider using contractionary demand management policies such as contractionary fiscal policy or increasing interest rate or appreciation of exchange rate as well as possible use of supply side policies such as subsidizing of factor of production or encourage adoption of technology etc. However, as mentioned in part a, there are possible rise in conflict between the macro goals so the government will need to take into consideration whether the possible rise of conflict when choosing the appropriate policy to use. Apart from taking into consideration the possible rise of conflict in macro goals, the government will also take into consideration of other factors such as the root cause of the rising prices, openness of the economy and the time lag etc.
Factor 1: Root cause of the rising inflation
As mentioned in the preamble, the recent inflation that most economies are experiencing is mainly due to the rising food and energy price. The rise in the food and energy price is due to the supply disruption caused by the border and movement restriction during the COVID-19 period as well as the rise in political conflict such as Russia – Ukraine war, which resulted in both fall in global food and oil supply. This resulted in the rising cost of production of all processed food items as well as transportation cost, so resulting in a rise in cost push inflation. As such, the government should choose to adopt short run supply-side policies such as subsidy for fuel or energy so as to help reduce the cost of production for the firms and increase the SRAS, thus reducing the general price level.
Whereas the use of demand management policy such as contractionary fiscal may have limited effectiveness in reducing the inflationary pressure caused by rising food and oil prices. As the government adopt contractionary fiscal policy like increase income tax, which cause household disposable income and purchasing power to reduce. This will then reduce the consumption level and AD, thus reducing the general price level. But the reduction of consumption may be limited as the food and energy are essential for survival, so the reduction in consumption for food and energy may not reduce significantly. Hence resulting in a limited reduction in AD and GPL, so limiting the effectiveness to tackle the inflationary pressure as the policy does not tackle the root cause of cost-push inflation.
Factor 2: Openness of the economy
If the economy is experiencing rising inflation mainly due to the rising AD, then the government may need to the degree of openness of the economy. As economies (such as Singapore and Hong Kong) which have a small domestic market often depend more on exports to boost their aggregate demand and the rise of the demand-pull inflation. Domestic consumption is small in relation to total aggregate demand. Due to the small relative size of domestic consumption and domestic investment and but a larger dependency of export, so the use of the contractionary fiscal policy of increase income tax and corporate tax or the use of monetary policy of increase in interest rate will have limited impact on aggregate demand. As the increase in interest rate will increase the cost of borrowing, which reduces consumption and investment. This will reduce the AD and GPL but the fall in AD is limited as the component of C and I contributing to the AD is relatively small. This will limit the increase in of AD and render the interest rate policy and fiscal policy to less effective than the exchange rate policy which will influence the larger component of AD mainly the net export. Whereas for an economy like China and US where they have a large domestic market, the fiscal and monetary policies will be more effective in reducing demand-pull inflation.
At the same time, if the small economies lack natural resources to produce, there will be a high dependence on imports both for production and consumption. So the adoption of the appreciation exchange rate policy will also be able to help reduce the rising imported price. As the exchange rate appreciation will lead to a fall in price of imported factor of production reduce the imported cost of production. Hence reducing the inflationary pressure due to rising imported price.
Factor 3: Time lags of various policy instruments

Fiscal tools such as changes in level of government expenditure, tax rates, changes in types of taxes have to be approved through parliamentary process. As a result these tools suffer from longer time lags compared to monetary policy instruments such as interest rates which will take less time for changes to take place. As such, there is a need to consider the speed at which a problem needs to be addressed. In some cases, a short term policy may be implemented in order to reduce the impact due to the urgency of the problem before long term policies are undertaken in order to resolve the underlying cause of the problem.
Possible conclusion/ evaluation:
● Government policy decisions are based on a multitude of factors thus conflict is not the sole factor.
However, the rising global food and energy prices may have increased the attention of governments
to the importance of the root cause of the inflation.
● Choice of policy may even be influenced by political interests such as political objectives of ruling
parties.",,
Explain one internal cause and one external cause of a balance of trade deficit of a country. [10],"Introduction:
A balance of trade deficit could be a result of a fall in the export revenue of domestically
produced goods and/or an increase in import expenditure on foreign goods. This could occur because of internal and/or external reasons.
Explain an internal cause of BOT deficit:
Higher domestic inflation relative to the rest of the world will reduce export competitiveness of a country and can cause a balance of trade deficit.
For example, India has been experiencing rising rates of inflation since the start of 2022. Assuming prices of other countries’ goods and services rise at a slower rate than India, a higher increase in domestic prices in India relative to the foreign prices will cause domestic households in India to increase demand for imported goods and services instead of domestically produced ones, thereby causing import expenditure to increase. At the same time, more expensive exports will cause foreigners to lower quantity demanded for the exports. Since the demand for India’s exports is likely to be price elastic due to availability of substitutes from other countries, the increase in price will lead to a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded, causing export revenue to fall, ceteris paribus. The falling export revenue and rising import expenditure worsen India’s trade balance and cause its balance of trade deficit to widen in 2022.
Explain an external cause of BOT deficit:
With globalisation and freer trade flows, competition from emerging economies may lead to the loss of comparative advantage of the more developed countries which can cause a balance of trade deficit.
If the country’s domestically produced goods are seen to be of a relatively lower quality or relatively higher priced compared to foreign goods, local consumers will switch to buying the relatively better quality of cheaper imported goods. This will result in a rise in demand for imports and import expenditure. On the other hand, foreigners will also buy
less of the domestically produced goods resulting in a fall in demand for the country’s exports and export revenue. The fall in export revenue and rise in import expenditure will lead to a worsening of a country’s trade balance. For example, the abundance of labour, land and other raw materials in China has resulted in a lower opportunity cost in the production of low-end manufactured goods than the developed countries like the US. This would mean that the Chinese low-end manufactured goods are more price competitive than the US goods. US will experience a fall in export demand and a rise in import demand. A loss in comparative advantage will thus lead to falling export revenue and rising import expenditure which worsen US’s trade balance and resulted in a balance of trade deficit.
Conclusion:
Thus, both internal and external causes may cause a balance of trade deficit.

Discuss whether protectionism is the most appropriate policy to improve balance of trade. [15] ,"
Introduction
To improve balance of trade, a government can adopt either expenditure-reducing or expenditure-switching policies to increase the export revenue of goods and services and/or decrease the import expenditure on goods and services. This essay will discuss how protectionism, contractionary fiscal policy, and supply-side policy can improve balance of trade. The appropriateness of these measures depends on the root causes of the balance of trade deficit, economic conditions, nature of the economy and the unintended consequences/ trade-offs in macroeconomic goals.
Policy 1: Explain how protectionism can improve balance of trade.
Protectionism is a form of expenditure-switching policy which aims to switch the expenditure of domestic households from foreign to domestic goods to reduce imports and/or switch the expenditure of foreign households to goods produced by the country to increase its exports.
For example, the US government imposed 200% import tariffs on solar panels imported from China. With the imposition of import tariff, t, the price of imported good increases from Pw to Pw+t, as shown in diagram below. As import prices increase, consumers will switch to cheaper domestically produced substitutes, and this will reduce the quantity demanded of imports from Qd-Qs to Q2-Q1. Assuming the demand for imports are price elastic (there are close substitutes produced by domestic firms), the increase in the price of imports will reduce the quantity demanded by more than proportionately leading to a fall in import expenditure. Ceteris paribus, balance of trade improves.
  
Limitations
● However, import tariffs may reduce export revenue if the export industry is reliant on imported raw materials. So, the overall impact on the trade balance is dependent on whether producers in the export industry can switch to cheaper domestic supplies. If the firms in the export industry use the imported raw materials that experience an increase in the price, the cost of production will increase and thus lead to an increase in the price of exports. If the demand for exports is price elastic, the quantity demanded for exports would decrease more than proportionately and thereby reducing export revenue. The overall impact on the net export would most probably be an improvement of the trade balance as the impact on the import expenditure is direct while the impact on the export revenue is more indirect where the imported raw materials may only take up a small portion of the total cost of producing the exports.
● The imposition of tariffs leads to the loss of consumer welfare. Consumers are worse off as domestic consumption of the good falls from OQd to OQ2 and they have to pay a higher price of Pw + t. The loss in consumer surplus is more than the gains to both producer and the government, leading to a welfare loss to the society shown by area (B+D).
● Rise in price of imported raw materials will also lead to a rise in the cost of production SRAS falls RNY falls and imported cost-push inflation occurs (unintended consequences)
Policy 2: Explain how contractionary fiscal policy can improve balance of trade.
A government may adopt contractionary fiscal policy (an expenditure reducing policy) to improve the balance of trade by reducing its import expenditure. For example, the US government can reduce government expenditure on education, healthcare, etc. and/or raise taxes to reduce aggregate demand. A rise in income tax will reduce the personal disposable income and ability to purchase goods and services. A rise in corporate tax will reduce the expected after-tax profits, hence reduces the incentive for firms to invest. Fall in G, C and I fall in AD firms will face an unplanned rise in inventories and therefore reduce production and require lesser factors of production and this will result in a fall in national income. With lower national income, there will be lower induced consumption from households and this will result in a downward multiplier process with a multiplied fall in the national income. As purchase of imports is dependent on the national income, the fall in national income will result in a fall in import expenditure which will help to improve BOT, ceteris paribus.
Limitations
● However, there may be conflict in macroeconomic goals depending on the state of the economy. If the economy is operating below full employment, this policy

may result in a rise in unemployment. Moreover, the fall in AD may fuel business pessimism and may induce firms to further cut down on investment. Therefore, besides reducing current RNY and employment, such policies also run the risk of reducing potential growth.
● Contractionary fiscal policy will be more appropriate if the economy is initially experiencing inflationary pressure, as a fall in AD will be able to cool down the economy and lower GPL. This will improve the price competitiveness of exports and will also encourage consumers to switch towards domestically produced goods which are now relatively cheaper than imports.
● If the consumer confidence and business outlook are very strong, the policy may not be able to reduce the consumption and investment expenditure significantly fall in RNY and hence import expenditure may not be significant limited
improvement in BOT
● The extent of fall in import expenditure will also depend on the marginal
propensity to import (MPM). For countries who have large MPM values i.e. MPM> 1, there will be more than proportionate fall in the demand for imports more significant improvement in BOT, ceteris paribus.
[Alternative policy: students can also explain how depreciation of currency can improve net exports and hence improve BOT.]
Policy 3: Explain how supply-side policy can improve balance of trade.
A government can adopt supply-side policies to increase its export revenue and hence improve balance of trade. For example, the Singapore government can provide grants, subsidies or tax incentives to encourage innovation and investment in research and development (e.g. the Productivity Solutions Grant which provides funding for firms that adopt technologies to improve productivity). These policies lower the cost of conducting R&D, incentivizing firms to conduct more R&D, enabling firms to improve the quality of its products and increase the demand for its exports. Moreover, with better production methods or processes, the firms will be able to improve productivity and generate more output with the given inputs, thus lowering unit costs of production. This will improve the price competitiveness of the exports and result in a rise in quantity demanded of exports. Assuming demand for the exports is price elastic (i.e. many close substitutes in the global market), there will be a rise in export revenue as the higher revenue gained from the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded will outweigh the loss in revenue from the fall in price of exports. This will improve the balance of trade, ceteris paribus.
Limitations
● However, the time taken for supply side policies to take effect tend to be long and the outcome is uncertain.

● In addition, investments in R&D may worsen the balance of trade position in the short-run as it may involve high import expenditures on capital goods from foreign countries, leading to a worsening of the BOT in the short-run.
● This policy is costly and can drain the government’s resources, diverting resources away from other areas of competing needs.
Conclusion/ Evaluation
● The appropriateness of these measures depends on the root causes of the balance of trade deficit, economic conditions, nature of the economy and the unintended consequences/ trade-offs in macroeconomic goals. To minimize the limitations that each policy possesses, the government can adopt a combination of expenditure reducing policy, expenditure switching policy and supply-side policies.
● Protectionism such as import tariffs is a quick-fix measure that can improve the balance of trade in the short run when economy is experiencing a large and persistent BOT deficit. But, the improvement in trade deficit brought about by the protectionist policy is likely to be short-lived if the root-cause for the BOT deficit is not addressed.
● If BOT deficit arises due to demand-pull inflation, then expenditure reducing policies like contractionary fiscal policy would be more appropriate than protectionism via import tariffs which can further increase the level of inflation in the country. If the root cause of the BOT deficit is lack of export competitiveness, then supply-side policies to improve the competitiveness of the exports will be more appropriate. However, as the effects of supply-side policies take time, and there may be other causes of the BOT deficit, other short-run policies may be required to complement the supply-side policies.",,
"In 2020, the Singapore government distributed reusable masks to all households. It highlighted that besides protecting others, the wearing of face masks can protect oneself better from the spread of COVID-19. During that same period, Singapore saw rising sale of fake face masks which are sub-standard masks with ineffective filtration layers.
(a) Explain how consumer ignorance and asymmetric information could lead to an inefficient allocation of resources in the market for face masks. [10]","Approach
Students are to recognise that this is a question on cause and effects of two sources of market failure.
R1: How imperfect information leading to consumer ignorance will lead to market failure. R2: How asymmetric information in the case of adverse selection will lead to market failure.
Suggested Answer
Introduction
When resources are allocated inefficiently in markets, market failure has occurred and this can be caused by imperfect information, where benefits or costs are over or underestimated and when once side of the market has more information than the other. In this essay, to simplify the analysis to focus on imperfect information, we will assume that there no externalities in the surgical face mask market to be analysed.
[P] One reason for market failure is consumer ignorance and this could lead to an inefficient allocation of resources in the market for surgical face masks.
[E+E] Consumers may lack full information on the benefits that can be obtained from consuming a good or service. For example, in the case of face masks, where some benefits such as increased protection from illnesses may not be immediately obvious, consumers may underestimate the true benefits that can be enjoyed from wearing an effective mask properly. As such, perceived marginal private benefit (MPB) from mask-wearing will be lower than true MPB (Fig.1). Consumers base their demand on perceived MPB. The demand curve thus reflects perceived MPB. Assuming no externalities, the true MPB equates the marginal social benefit (MSB), while marginal private cost (MPC) equates marginal social cost (MSC).


[E+E] Left to the free market, market outcome will be where demand equates supply at output Q and price P (Fig. 1). However, socially optimal level of output where welfare is maximised is where MSB = MSC at Q*. There is thus underconsumption of surgical face masks because of consumer ignorance. For every unit between Q and Q*, MSB is higher than MSC; consuming one more unit thus adds more to total social benefit than to total social cost. The underconsumption of QQ* units thus lead to a welfare loss of area M.
[L] As such, consumer ignorance is one reason for market failure in the market for face masks when there is consumer ignorance.
[P] One other reason for market failure when there is information failure is the possibility of adverse selection.
[E+E] Adverse selection can occur when information between consumer and producer is asymmetric. One type of asymmetric information is where the sellers may have much more information than the buyers. This can happen in the market for disposable face masks. In the market, there would be both high quality disposable face masks (also known as “cherries”) and poor quality face masks e.g. those with ineffective filtration layers (also known as “lemons”).
The sellers of disposable face masks, know more about the quality of the masks they are selling (e.g. the effectiveness of the filtration layers used etc.) than do the buyers, who might not know of the filtration efficiency. The price that sellers are willing to accept is based on the quality of the masks which is known to them. The seller of a “cherry” is therefore prepared to sell the mask only if he is offered a high price. For a “lemon”, he is prepared to accept a low price.
While a buyer would be willing to pay a high price for a “cherry” and a low price for a “lemon”, the buyer lacks information on the standard of the disposable masks. As such, buyers would offer a price averaging the value of a “cherry” and a “lemon” for the masks (lower than for a “cherry”, but higher than for a “lemon”).
However, sellers of “cherries” would be unwilling to sell their good quality disposable masks for the average price and hence, would leave the market. On the other hand, sellers of “lemons” would find the price acceptable and be willing to sell their masks. With “cherries” leaving the market and more “lemons” joining, the average quality of masks in the disposable mask market will fall. This leads buyers to offer increasingly lower ‘average’ prices. More and more sellers of “cherries” would leave the market, and the market becomes increasingly concentrated with low quality masks. The ‘average price’ offered by less informed buyers drives the high quality masks from the market.

[L] This leads to market failure because the potential welfare to society that can be obtained from buying and selling high quality masks is lost.",,
(b) Evaluate the alternative policies that can be adopted by the Singapore government to correct both these market failures. [15],"
Approach
Students are to evaluate at least 2 policies to correct the market failure associated with consumer ignorance and adverse selection in the market for face masks. There will be a heavier-than-usual contextual requirement for this question as it is explicitly stated in the question, so the analysis must be backed up by real-world examples.
R1: Explain how a policy by the Singapore government could improve allocative efficiency in the case of consumer ignorance and adverse selection in the market for face masks.
R2: Explain how another policy by the Singapore government could improve allocative efficiency in the case of consumer ignorance and adverse selection in the market for face masks.
Evaluation marks:
Well-argued evaluative judgements should be made about the effectiveness of the various policies, taking into consideration the context of Singapore.
Suggested Answer
Introduction
One objective of the government is to achieve allocative efficiency, where resources are allocated in a way which maximises societal welfare. Consumer ignorance regarding the benefits of wearing face masks which leads to an under-consumption of masks, as well adverse selection, leading to an over-consumption of sub-standard masks will result in allocative inefficiency explained in part (a).As such, the government must intervene to correct these market failures in the form of public education as well as government provision. The policies can be evaluated based on certain criteria, such as the extent to which the allocative efficiency has improved, the fiscal sustainability as well as whether it leads to a trade-off with the micro-economic goal of equity. (Alt answers: strict regulations).

Body
Government provision
[P] Government intervention, such as free provision can lead to more efficient outcomes in the market for face masks when there is consumer ignorance.
[E+E] To encourage consumption in the case of information failure leading to underconsumption, the government may choose to directly provide face masks to all households for free. From the Figure 2 below, when P is now at 0, quantity demanded will increase from Q to Q’, reducing the allocative inefficiency due to the under-consumption of face masks. For example, by the end of the Circuit Breaker in 2020, the Singapore government had rolled out multiple mask distribution exercises to all households, to encourage greater consumption of face masks. This was done in a bid to cope with the spread of the Covid19 virus during the pandemic then.
[L] Hence, government intervention in the form of free provision of face masks will increase consumption of the good, correcting the market failure associated with consumer ignorance.

[Ev] As information is imperfect in the real world, a government is likely to have difficulty in attaching a monetary value to the exact extent of imperfect information. In the worst case scenario, an over- estimation of the consumer’s info gap can occur. This could lead to the government excessively proving a good for free to all households, leading to a greater welfare loss, if area B is greater than area A in Fig.2 above. Nevertheless, in the case of the pandemic, the market failure associated with information failure was too huge for the government to ignore, hence, various organisations like A*star were roped in to ensure that the masks provided were of excellent filtration qualities, to reduce the transmission of the virus.

[P] Free provision of face masks by the government can lead to more efficient outcomes in the case of an adverse selection problem.
[E, E] The government can ensure that Singaporeans are wearing good quality masks by distributing masks with effective filtration layers to all households. With each new distribution exercise that rolled out in 2020, the quality of the reusable masks improved too, ensuring that the households are well-protected. For example, the government contracted a hygiene technology company, Livinguard, for the fourth distribution exercise, which promised a water-repellent antimicrobial outer layer as well as an antimicrobial treatment in the inner layer. This helps to guarantee the accessibility of good quality masks that households should be wearing to safeguard themselves and others,
[L] improving the allocative efficiency outcome in the market for face masks.
[Ev] This improved equity too, as lower income households have access to good quality masks. Nevertheless, government provision of masks may not be sustainable if the pandemic persists. There is opportunity cost incurred and it may strain government’s budget – increased spending in this area may mean less spending in other areas – e.g. less spending on education. This may result in welfare loss in other areas.
Public education
[P] Public education can improve the market outcome when there is consumer ignorance.
[E+E] In the case of surgical face masks, public education for example, through social media campaigns, works by educating consumers on the true benefits of wearing face masks. Campaigns will ensure that the public is made aware that the risk of transmissions of virus can be mitigated significantly if they were to wear effective face masks, properly. Demand for face masks will be rising as the gap between perceived MPB and true MPB narrows and consumers become more willing to consume face masks. With full information on the benefits of mask-wearing, the new demand now coincides with the true MPB, as shown in Fig.1. The new demand will now cut the market supply curve at Q*;
[L] market outcome is improved as welfare loss of rea M will be eliminated. This is because with government intervention, the socially optimal level of output is now being produced and consumed.
[Ev] However, consumers may not be responsive to public education, especially in the short run since it takes time for mindset and habits to change. As such, demand will not change very much and there will still be under-consumption of surgical face masks which mean that market failure may still persist.
[P] Public education can also improve the market outcome when there is adverse selection.
[E+E] Public campaigns may be used in cases of adverse selection in the market for disposable masks. For example, the government can roll out initiatives to provide consumers with a guide on how to check the bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), which will give the wearer a more adequate protection from contact with droplets and sprays that may contain germs. An effective mask, or a “cherry”, with a high BFE also filters out large particles in the air when the wearer breathes inAs such, informed consumers will be able to discern a “lemon” from a “cherry”, and hence will offer a price befitting of an effective mask, preventing sellers of “cherries” from leaving the market.
[L] The market outcome will be improved as allocative efficiency increases. This is because with government intervention, the socially optimal level of output is now being produced and consumed.

[Ev] However, even if consumers are well-informed on how to choose high quality masks, there will be pockets of the society who would not be able to afford these “cherries”. In some cases, they may still choose to consume “lemons” as the “cherries” could be beyond what they could afford, and they market for face mask will still be allocatively inefficient.
Regulations
[P] The Singapore government may also impose regulations to directly influence consumers’ behaviour.
[E+E] For example, the government made it mandatory for face masks by everyone above the age of 2 to be worn at all times in public spaces. Individuals who flouted the rule by refusing to wear a mask were fined and recalcitrant offenders were prosecuted in court. By enforcing mask-wearing, this ensured that the optimal quantity of face masks was being consumed when there was consumer ignorance,
[L] correcting the market failure due to under-consumption in the market for face masks.
[P] Government regulations could also lead to better outcomes in the case of adverse selection in the market for face masks.
[E+E] By regulating the importing of masks (e.g. from approved mask producers only), local mask producers must meet certain standards and filtration capabilities before they are approved by the HSA to manufacture masks. This would therefore incentivise producers to produce high quality masks, and producers of fake masks will leave the market if they know that their sub-par masks will not be demanded since consumers are able to now distinguish between a “cherry” from a “lemon”.
[L] Hence, the allocative efficiency in the market for face masks will improve with strict regulations imposed by the government.
[Ev] However, regulations require active monitoring and enforcement by the task force and legal teams, which would require the use of public funds and can be difficult to sustain in the long run. A frequent lack of punishment might lead to people flouting the rules more often and reduces the effectiveness of the policy in reducing consumption levels.
Conclusion
[Stand] With all things considered, public education by the government is the best policy to solve the problem of imperfect information in the market for face masks.
[Substantiation] This is because giving consumers more information will reduce the extent of information failure greatly and help them to make better choices. Even if the consumers are not very responsive to the campaign, any change in the demand closer to where demand would be should consumers have full information would mean market output is now closer to Q*, and there would be a smaller welfare loss.
However, this has to be complemented by other policies such as government regulation and free provision. Govt regulation is needed for more immediate impact in correcting the market failure since it takes time to educate the public. Free provision is needed because lower income households may not have the means to have access to these goods, even if they have perfect information on the true benefits of wearing it. However, there should not be continued free provision of face masks for all households. Since the education level of the Singapore residents is quite high, this means that left to market forces, the

under-consumption level is not that high. With the perceived MPB not being that much lower than true MPB, free provision is more likely to lead to greater welfare loss. Thus, free provision should apply only to residents who can’t afford face masks.
It is also impractical to solely rely on public education to address the fake mask problem because even with knowledge of what constitutes a good / effective face masks, consumers will not know whether the sellers are being unscrupulous in hiding information about the poor quality of their masks. Government regulation of the producers is thus needed. With Singapore, being a relatively small country, the implementation of strict government regulations is also financially feasible.",,
"Food in restaurants and hawker centers have risen with food prices at restaurants having increased at a faster pace compared to hawker food. Food vouchers for hawker centers have been issued by the Singapore government to help the lower-income households.
(a) Using the demand-supply model, explain why prices of food in restaurants rose at a faster rate compared to food in hawker centres when energy cost rose. [10]","Requirements for (a):
R1: Explain how the rise in energy cost affects the prices of food in restaurants and hawker centres.
R2: Explain why (difference in PED value and extent of impact) the rate of increase in food prices differ between restaurants and hawker centres as a result.
Suggested answer (a):
Introduction
The price of food in general can be analyzed using the demand-supply framework. Demand refers to the quantity of a good that consumers are able and willing to buy at various price levels during a given period. Supply refers to the quantity of a good that producers offer to consumers in a given period at a given price.
Body
[P] The rise in energy cost will lead to a rise in the price of food.
[E, E] The rise in energy cost affects all aspects of the food production process and will result in a fall in supply. For an additional unit of food produced, additional units of energy are needed to cook the food. Hence, the rise in energy cost leads to a rise in the marginal cost of production. When energy prices increase, ceteris paribus, the supply curve will shift upwards because for every unit that is produced, it now cost more to produce the same quantity. Thus, the supply of food will fall as illustrated in Figure 1 below, the supply curve will shift from S to S’.

R1: Explain how the rise in energy cost affects the prices of food in restaurants and hawker centres.

Body
[P] The rise in energy cost will lead to a rise in the price of food.
[E, E] The rise in energy cost affects all aspects of the food production process and will result in a fall in supply. For an additional unit of food produced, additional units of energy are needed to cook the food. Hence, the rise in energy cost leads to a rise in the marginal cost of production. When energy prices increase, ceteris paribus, the supply curve will shift upwards because for every unit that is produced, it now cost more to produce the same quantity. Thus, the supply of food will fall as illustrated in Figure 1 below, the supply curve will shift from S to S’.

[P] The difference in the price elasticity of demand for food in restaurants vs hawker centres leads to the difference in the rate of increase of food prices
[E, E] The demand for food in restaurants tend to be more price inelastic relative to the food in hawker centres. This is because there are more available substitutes such as fast food that are in the same price range for hawker-centre food compared to those provided by restaurants. Food in restaurants is usually produced by renowned chefs and has lesser substitutes in its price range.
In contrast, it is easier to find similar dishes in different hawker centres such as home-cooked food or fast food that are in the same price range. Hence, the demand for food in hawker centres tend to be more price elastic while that for restaurants is more price inelastic.
When there is a rise in energy cost, the supply curve for food will fall since it is now more expensive to produce each unit of food. As seen in Figure 1 above, the upward shift in the supply curve from S to S’ leads to a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded for food produced in hawker centres (from Qe to QH) while that for restaurants fall from Qe to

QR. This is because the less price elastic the demand, the greater the rise in price that is needed to clear the market.
[L] As such, the rise in price for food in restaurants is more significant than those produced in hawker centres.
Alternative response:
[P] The difference in the magnitude of shift in the supply curve for food produced in restaurants and hawker centres will also lead to a difference in the rate of increase in food prices
[E, E] In addition to the difference in PED value for the demand for food in restaurants versus that in hawker centres, the rise in energy cost will affect these two types of producers differently. Energy costs is a bigger percentage of total costs for restaurants because of the size of their operations. Restaurants need to provide dedicated seating and space for their patrons only while hawker centres make use of shared spaces for their customers. In addition, most restaurants are also air-conditioned that leads to higher operating cost. As such, restaurants will experience an upward shift in their supply curve to a larger extent compared to hawker centres, assuming demand for restaurant food and hawker food have the same price elasticity.
[L] Hence, food prices in restaurants will rise to a larger extent.
Conclusion
Given the relatively more price inelastic demand, an upward shift in the supply curve of a greater extent will result in food prices in restaurants rising more significantly than that in hawker centres. Since food in hawker centres have more available substitutes, its demand is more price elastic. Although its operating cost may rise when energy prices rise, the supply curve shifts upwards by a lesser extent.
In our analysis, we have assumed that the demand remains unchanged and all other factors are assumed to be constant.",,
(b) Discuss whether providing food vouchers is the best measure the Singapore government can undertake to address the rising price of food. [15],"Requirement for (b):
R1: Explain how food vouchers work to address the issue of rising food prices (ie. Improve inequity) and its limitations
R2: Explain an alternative measure (eg. Subsidy to producers to mitigate rise in cost of production) that may be undertaken to improve the inequity caused by rising food prices and its limitations
EV: Provide comparison between food voucher vs the alternative in terms of the following:
- Effectiveness of policy measure; extent of trade off (allocative efficiency)
- Context of Singapore (food constitute a large proportion of households’ incomes)
that affects inequity
- Cause and duration of rise in energy cost that affects fiscal sustainability
Suggested answer (b):
Introduction
Rising food prices affect all households in Singapore. To address the impact of rising food prices, the Singapore government can provide food vouchers such as those CDC vouchers households to help defray the rise in food cost. Alternatively, the Singapore government can also provide subsidies to producers to help mitigate the rise in energy cost, leading to lower production cost and thus, food prices.
To do so, the Singapore government will also consider the effectiveness of measures undertaken to solve the problem, its ability to fund and sustain these measures and possible trade-offs such as allocative inefficiency.
Body
[P] The provision of food vouchers can help lower-income households cope with rising food prices.
[E, E] Food vouchers such as the CDC vouchers could be given to all households during the period when food prices are rising. This is to ensure that households continue to be able to afford food necessity. These vouchers can then be used in most hawker centres but not for restaurants. The aim is to help the lower-income households who frequent hawker centres.
Figure 2. How vouchers mitigate the fall in supply

As seen in Figure 2, the rise in energy cost has resulted in a fall in quantity demanded for food in hawker centres from Qe to QH as prices rise from Pe to PH. The provision of food vouchers will result in a rise in demand for households from D (hawker) to D (hawker w voucher) because these vouchers are equivalent to cash that can be used for the purchase of food.
[L] Hence, we can see that the rise in demand due to the food voucher has resulted in a rise in quantity of food from QH to QV.
[EV] Assuming market was initially efficient, the fall in supply would have led to a market outcome at equilibrium point e where the price is PH and quantity is QH. The implementation of the voucher would increase consumption to QV, that leads to welfare loss of area eab. The larger the amount of voucher given that raised consumption, the larger the welfare loss area.
[EV] The value of food vouchers needs to be sufficiently substantial to make a significant difference to help improve their access to affordable food. As such, the funding requirement for this initiative can be challenging, especially if there are fiscal constraints faced the government. In addition, there may be other trade-offs when the government decides to prioritize spending in this undertaking that may affect other areas of fiscal spending.
[P] The Singapore government can also provide subsidies to food producers to reduce the price of food.
[E, E] A subsidy that is given to food producers will lead to a downward shift in the supply curve. This is because for each unit of food produced, the subsidy will reduce the cost of producing that additional unit.
Figure 3. Subsidy to producers increases quantity demanded

As seen in Figure 3, the subsidy will shift the supply curve from S’ to S’’, mitigating the upward shift caused by the rise in energy cost (S to S’). This subsidy will result in a new market equilibrium at point E’’ where the equilibrium price is Pe’ and quantity demanded is Q’H. While the consumption level is still lower than Qe, it is now higher than that without subsidy.
[L] Hence, a subsidy is able to help households increase some of their consumption through the lowering of price of food.
[EV] Assuming no externalities and so QH is socially optimal, the subsidy leads to over-production by Q’H – QH units, leading to allocative inefficiency. As seen in Figure 3 above, the subsidy has resulted in an artificially lowered marginal cost, S’’ compared to the true marginal cost, S’. As such, there will be a welfare loss of the shaded triangle because of the allocation of resources to lower the true marginal cost.
[EV] Such subsidy would have a heavy burden on the government especially if the rise in energy cost is substantial.
[P] A maximum price may also be used to reduce the price of food.
[E, E] A maximum price is set below the market equilibrium price. It is the highest price that producers are legally allowed to charge in a market. As seen in Figure 4 below, the rise in energy cost shifted the supply curve from S to S’ has created a shortage of Qe – Qe’’. As a result, the new equilibrium price will rise from Pe to Pe’ and new equilibrium quantity from Qe to Qe’.
Let us assume the maximum price is now set at Pmax. Doing so will help to lower the price of food.
[L] As such, a maximum price is able to lower the price of food.
[EV] However, such price control measure leads to shortage. At this price, consumers will be willing to consume up to Qc. This is because the lowered price will increase the quantity demanded for food. However, producers of food are only willing to offer Qp because the lowered price will also lower their willingness to offer more for sale. Hence, a greater shortage of Qp-Qc is created. Assuming the market to be efficient, the production of only Qp units, which is an under-production in relation to the socially optimal level of QH (assuming no externalities) leads to welfare loss of the shaded area abc. This policy also creates other problems in the distribution of it. In this case, an appropriate allocation system will need to be present to ensure the poor also have access to food. Without perfect information, it will be difficult to ascertain what level to impose the maximum price.

Note: Any other measure that can bring about a rise in consumption level can be accepted Eg. Subsidy on process innovation that leads to lowering of cost of production)
Conclusion/Evaluation
[Stand] While the provision of food vouchers has its limitations, it is a better measure than production subsidies.
The provision of food voucher alone is not the best method to deal with rising food prices. There are other measures that may be used.
[Substantiation] Food voucher provision can be more targeted at the lower-income households despite the fixed-dollar amount may also not be sufficient to offset the rising cost of energy prices that food producers are able to pass on to consumers. The dollar value of these vouchers can be graduated such that the lower the income levels, the higher the dollar value is given. As such, it can also be more fiscally sustainable.
Although various forms of government intervention will lead to misallocation of resources if market was initially efficient, a production subsidy may reduce the incentive to minimize cost by producers. Price ceiling would be even worse because it not only leads to allocative inefficiency but also greater shortages over time.
The ability of the government to finance these measures depend on the size of funding needed and the duration of the need to do so. If the rise in energy cost continues indefinitely, the Singapore government will face a challenge to fund such assistance to help the poorer households mitigate the rise in food prices. Thus, the long-term solution is to boost households’ incomes for a more sustainable solution to rising food prices.",,

Nike is the market leader in the global sports footwear industry. Nike’s business strategies include building its brand through sports celebrity endorsements,
19
 
developing products that have high-quality, market-leading technology and acquiring competing sports brands.
(a) Explain two ways in which a profit-maximising firm like Nike could benefit from acquiring another firm in the same industry. [10]","Part (a)
Approach
Students should explain the two ways that firms can benefit from an acquisition of a firm in the same industry (i.e. horizontal integration). Acquisitions allow firms to benefit from (i) cost savings arising from producing at a larger scale, and (ii) charging higher prices due to greater market power.
R1: Explain how the acquisition of another firm in the same industry can lead to cost savings that boost total profits
R2: Explain how the acquisition of another firm in the same industry can lead to higher TR that boost total profits.
Outline
Introduction
An acquisition refers to the situation when a firm buys out and takes ownership of another firm. Firms may decide to acquire another firm in the same industry to pursue cost savings and/or increased market share, with the underlying motive of maximise profits.
Body
[P] Acquisitions can benefit a profit maximizing firm as it can lead to cost savings arising from greater internal economies of scale
[E, E] The increased scale of production from the acquisition may lead to greater scope for reaping internal EOS, which refers to fall in AC arising from increased scale of production of a firm. For example, Nike had acquired another sneaker company Converse. This may allow Nike to utilise bigger capacity machines or warehouses for distribution. Total cost may increase less than proportionately to the increase in output produced. This is as the firm only needs a less than proportionate increase in number of workers to operate larger capacity machines or when the storage volume of the warehouses rises more than in proportion to their building costs, due to cost savings with increased scale. This allows the firm to enjoy lower average cost of production.


With reference to Fig 1, before the acquisition, the firm would set its output at Q based on the profit-maximising condition of SRMC1=MR, and charge a corresponding price of P. After the acquisition, the firm now operates with a bigger plant with SRAC and SRMC curve represented by SRAC2 and SRMC2. When the MC is lowered, the profit-maximising firm now finds that MR exceeds MC and adjusts its output to Q2 where MR cuts SRMC2. As AC is lowered, the firm is able to sell its products at a lower price (P1 to P2) and is thus more price competitive. [L] Profits increase from [(P1-C1) x Q1] to [(P2-C2) x Q2] due to the cost savings.
[P] Acquisitions can benefit a profit maximizing firm as it can lead to higher revenue and hence higher profit earned by the firm due to greater market power
[E, E] Market power, also known as monopoly power, refers to a firm’s ability to influence the market price of the good it sells. The higher the firm’s market power, the greater the firm’s ability to influence the market price. By acquiring another firm (e.g. Converse) in the same industry, Nike can now capture a larger market share as the customer base from both firms are now combined, which leads to higher demand for the firm. Demand for the firm’s products also becomes less price elastic as consumers now have fewer substitutes to switch to.

With reference to the diagram in Fig. 2, before the acquisition, the demand curve and MR curve for the individual firm would resemble DD and MR respectively. The firm would then set its output at Q based on the profit-maximising condition of MC=MR, and charge a corresponding price of P. Assuming similar costs, with the acquisition, the firm now has a demand curve which resembles DD’ and hence an MR curve which resembles MR’ as it faces a higher level of demand and demand for its services is less price elastic.
As demand increases from DD to DD’, the firm will adjust its output to where MR’=MC. Price and output sold increases to P’ and Q’ respectively, leading to higher TR which is price multiplied by quantity sold. Profits therefore increase, assuming the rise in TR is greater than the rise in TC.
[L] The acquisition can allow the firm can enjoy higher profits, from [(P-C) x Q] to [(P’-C’) x Q’].

Discuss the view that governments should stop firms from acquiring other firms in the same industry. [15],"Approach
To discuss the view that governments should stop firms from acquiring other firms in the same industry, students need to consider the pros and cons of acquisitions based on government’s microeconomic objectives of efficiency and equity. As the question does not specify the industry chosen, students can evaluate the view based on the nature of different industries.
R1: Explain at least 1 reason why governments should stop firms from acquiring other firms in the same industry
R2: Explain at least 1 reason why governments should not stop firms from acquiring other firms in the same industry.
The judgment will require weighing the arguments for and against by considering the type of industry, with examples.

Outline
Introduction
Governments examine the pros and cons when it stops a firm from acquiring another firm in the same industry, based on the impact on society as a whole, considering the impact on efficiency of resource allocation, rate of innovation and equity.
Body
Arguments for government stopping acquisitions
[P] Governments can prevent the combined firm from abusing its higher market power, which can lower allocative efficiency and consumer surplus.

[E+E] The acquisition result in increased market power and hence greater welfare loss. With reference to Figure 3 above, before the acquisition, the welfare loss is represented by area abc. This welfare loss is due to underproduction since for the units between the initial profit maximising output level, Q, and the allocative efficient level, Q* (where DD cuts MC), P>MC. This means society values each of the units more than the MC of producing it yielding a net gain for society. By not producing those units, society lost the potential gain in welfare of area abc.
After the acquisition, the new price is higher at P’, which creates a larger divergence from the allocative efficient price level (P’ > MC at Q**), and consequently the welfare loss is represented by area def. The underproduction now is larger, between output Q’ and Q** units (the new allocative efficient level is at Q** where DD’ cuts MC). This area of welfare loss def is now bigger than the initial area abc. [L] This results in greater allocative inefficiency.
[E+E] Consequently, with higher prices, consumer surplus falls. Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the price that households are willing and able to buy goods at and the price they actually pay. Assuming that the demand curve for the market remains the same, the higher price causes the consumer surplus to be lower.
[P] Governments should stop acquisitions as it may prevent greater inequity in distribution of goods and services
[E+E] As the expanded firm enjoys greater market share, it will face a higher demand as the firm captures a larger share of market demand. The firm will also have a more price inelastic demand as there are now fewer firms in the market after the acquisition, which means there are fewer substitutes available. As a result, consumers are now charged a higher price of P’, while firms enjoy an increase in profits from [(P-C) x Q] to [(P’-C’) x

Q’], as seen in Fig. 2 in part (a). [L] This worsens inequity of income distribution between consumers and shareholders of the firm, who are presumably more affluent members of the society. A more unequal income distribution will lead to greater inequitable access to goods and services.
Arguments for allowing acquisition
[P] Governments should allow acquisitions if the firm can reap cost savings due to economies of scale, which enable domestic firms to be better able to compete against foreign firms.
[E] As mentioned in (a), the increased scale of production from acquiring another firm can lead to greater scope for reaping internal EOS which refers to the fall in AC arising from increased scale of production of a firm.
[E] For example, Nike acquiring Converse can allow for streamlining of their production line to manufacture sneakers at a cheaper cost (e.g. assembly lines can be shared, shared technologies between Air Jordan and Converse basketball sneakers). [L] These cost savings can help the firm charge a competitive price in the global market and able to compete against foreign firms which may also have a large EOS due to their high level of output.
[E+E] Consequently, if firms are willing to pass on these cost savings to consumers, consumers now can buy more footwear at lower prices, and enjoy higher consumer surplus. [L] Since consumers welfare improves, governments should allow acquisitions.
[Ev] However, if firms like Nike instead face diseconomies of scale, the higher average costs may result in worsened outcomes for society. For example, since Nike is already one of the largest firms in the sportswear market with a global presence, additional horizontal integration may result in greater challenges in communication between managers and employees, or more challenging coordination efforts when Nike is employs strategies (e.g. advertising will need to be targeted to the country’s tastes and preferences). These increased costs might be undesirable for a society if Nike were to pass on these costs to consumers, and instead worsen consumer surplus instead.
[P] Government should allow for acquisitions because the profits earned can be used to spur more innovation and improve dynamic efficiency.
[E+E] From (a), acquisitions can benefit firms to earn more profits through reaping economies of scale from [(P1-C1) x Q1] to [(P2-C2) x Q2] in Fig. 1 and increasing market share from [(P-C) x Q] to [(P’-C’) x Q’] in Fig. 2. With a higher demand and lowered costs, the firm can earn more profits, which are crucial for a firm like Nike to sustain research and development (R&D).
[E+E] Since R&D tends to be costly and inherently risky with uncertain results. With increased profits earned, firms have greater ability to undertake investments in R&D. For example, Nike has been undertaking innovative efforts in multiple areas, creating the Nike Zoom Vaporfly to set new world marathon records and using augmented reality (AR) for consumers to experience their newest shoe offerings. This form of product innovation can enhance dynamic efficiency as consumers get to enjoy better quality products.
[E+E] Moreover, process innovation such as adopting automation technologies to assemble footwear can help to lower variable costs, which lower MC and AC. This causes Nike to raise output levels at a new profit maximising output since MR is now greater than MC. This lowers price as a result, and consumers now benefit more as they receive higher consumer surplus, and [L] improves society’s welfare over time.
Other possible points
[P] Governments should stop acquisitions as it may lead to X-inefficiency

● Acquisitions lead to decreased competition which can lead to complacency – i.e. the firm doesn’t do its best to produce at least cost
Conclusion
[Stand] Whether governments should stop firms from acquiring other firms from the same industry depends on the significance of the impact on abusing market share vs reaping cost savings from EOS.
Governments should allow acquisitions if it is likely to lead to cheaper prices for consumers or be willing to innovate to improve dynamic efficiency. However, governments should stop acquisitions if firms are seen to abuse their increased market power.
[Substantiation] To judge whether the acquisition should be allowed, the government has to consider the extent to which market power will be increased. Also, whether the price is likely to rise or fall, which entail considering the extent to which the acquisition will result in increased opportunity to reap internal EOS. The type of good in question is also an important consideration – e.g. whether the good is a merit good / demerit good.
*Note – the Evaluation angles are non-exhaustive, and the intent is to show how one can conclude differently based on different contexts, and to complement the tools of analysis used.
[Ev angle 1*: Depends on firms’ willingness and ability to innovate] For the case of the sports footwear industry, governments should allow Nike to acquire another firm. The acquisition allows Nike to intensify its R&D efforts to greatly improve dynamic efficiency. As Nike is a world leader in sportswear making, it has created better quality products to help athletes perform better through cushioning technologies like Nike Zoom Fly and React. By acquiring another firm like Reebok, Nike will be able to amalgamate its technologies to improve sportswear in other fields (e.g. Cross training), and further offer consumers higher quality choices over time and improving dynamic efficiency. Allocative inefficiency, on the hand, will likely not increase as much, since sportswear production is labour-intensive causing the minimum efficient scale to not be high, and thus there are many smaller firms like Decathlon who can contest the market to produce at a competitive price. Hence, Nike will likely keep its prices down at a reasonable level for consumers to afford, for its mass market range.
[Ev angle 2: Depends on the firms’ strategies post-acquisition] On top of that, Nike may be able to confer positive externalities to society if more consumers use their sportswear and health tracking applications for exercise. For example, by acquiring another firm, Nike earn higher profits and be more able to advertise Nike+ Run App to existing fitness trackers like the Apple Watch and Garmin fitness trackers. Through a better-quality product, consumers be spurred to exercise more, and improve their cardiovascular health, and in turn confer third party benefits (MSB>MPB) through higher labour productivity in the workplace. This is in line with the Singapore government’s push for a healthy lifestyle, where Health Promotion Board had partnered with private firms like Apple to gamify fitness tracking through Lumihealth, a game that rewards consumers when they track exercise on the Apple Watch. Thus, this might overall be more beneficial for society, and is a reason why governments should allow acquisitions to occur.
[Ev angle 3: Depends on nature and type of good: Merit goods] For the case of hospital services, the increased opportunity to reap EOS from increased scale of production is not extensive due to its nature of more personalized service and human capital intensity in production. This means an acquisition of another hospital is more likely to bring about exploitation of market power rather than EOS. This benefits the producers rather than the consumers (since price is likely to end up higher than lower). In fact, consumers are more likely to end up worse off. Moreover, as this is a necessity, the implication for inequity of distribution is serious. Moreover, hospital service (which can include the health screening services) can be regarded as a merit good by society. Such a good is already under-consumed in a competitive market. The increased market power will worsen the under-consumption of such a good. By not allowing the acquisition however, the potential benefit of increased R&D is sacrificed. But this problem can be reduced if the government funds R&D in medical care.

"Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, Singapore closed its borders to short term visitors and some foreign labourers in 2020.
(a) Using AD-AS analysis, explain how the closure of international borders can adversely affect an economy. [10]","Introduction
To analyze the effects on an economy, we will use the AD-AS model. Through this model, we are able to explain how the changes in AD and AS will affect the economy in terms of economic growth, unemployment and inflation.
Body
[P] The closure of international borders will result in a fall in the AD for an economy.
[E, E] The aggregate demand (AD) for an economy is made up of the consumption expenditure (C), investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G) and net trade expenditure (X-M). The closure of international borders will lead to fall in the AD for an economy via a fall in (X-M) and a possible fall in I.
For example, for a country like Singapore that relies on tourism, which is a form of service export, the closure of international borders meant that there will be a reduction in the number of tourists that visit Singapore. This would lead to a fall in export revenue (X). Thus, assuming import expenditure (M) to be unchanged, the fall in (X-M) will lead to a fall in the AD.
When a country like SG closes its border to some foreign workers, this also leads to an increased anticipation of a rise in wage costs that may deter the inflow of foreign direct investments (FDI) as well as cause a reduction in domestic investments. Hence, the reduction in investments will also lead to a fall in the AD.
With border closures, there will also be supply chain disruptions that leads to a reduction in the volume of trade. This could result in a fall in (X-M). For countries that are particularly dependent on export growth, this could result in a fall in its AD.
[Note: Other reasons include fall in C and I due to expectations of closure that worsens business outlook]
[L] Thus, the closure of international borders not only affect (X-M) but also lead to a temporary fall in (I), leading to an overall fall in the AD for a country.

[P] The closure of international borders will result in a fall in the AS for an economy.
[E, E] The fall in the aggregate supply (AS) for an economy may be caused by a rise in the unit cost of production (UCOP) or a fall in the productive capacity (LRAS). The closure of international borders may lead to a fall in the quantity of factors of production (FOP) that is needed for production. Such a temporary shortage would lead to a rise in price (wage for labour), leading to a rise in cost of production.
For example, raw materials are now more expensive due to supply chain disruptions (shortage of workers globally that leads to rise in shipping costs). For a country like Singapore that lacks natural resources, the rise in raw material cost will lead to a rise in the UCOP. Hence, there will be a fall in the AS.
In addition, for a country like Singapore that relies heavily on foreign workers from Malaysia, she may suddenly face a shortage because these workers are now unable to cross the border to work here. This would also lead to a rise in the UCOP, leading to a fall in the AS in the short term. If this is prolonged, the overall capacity of the country would fall because of the reduction in the quantity of labour in the country.
[L] Hence, the closer of international borders can affect both the UCOP as well the productive capacity of a country, leading to a fall in the AS.


[P] The fall in AD and AS will have negative impact on an economy.
[E, E] Initially, the economy is operating at AD1 and AS1 where the equilibrium national income is Y1 and the full-employment output level is at Yf. As seen in Figure 1, the fall in AD is illustrated by a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve from AD1 to AD2. When that happens, there will be an unplanned rise in inventory levels that causes firms to cut down on production. As the firms do so, household incomes will fall because firms now hire lesser workers. This fall in income will result in a fall in induced consumption of domestically produced goods/services that leads to a further fall in AD. This will result in firms cutting down on production again that leads to further fall in households’ incomes. This process will continue until total injection = total withdrawal and a new level of equilibrium national income is achieved. Correspondingly, there will be a rise in demand-deficient unemployment due to increase in output gap of Y2-Yf.
The fall in the AS is illustrated by an upward shift in the AS curve from AS1 to AS2. As the UCOP rises, there will be fall in national income (due to a fall in the wealth effect) from Y2 to

Y3 that is seen in the movement along AD2. One reason for the upward movement along the AD is the real wealth effect where the fall in real wealth discourages consumption.
[L] The resultant effect of a fall in AD and AS is a fall in national income (Y1 to Y3) and rise in the general price level (P1 to P2).
Conclusion
The prolonged closure of international borders will lead to fall in actual growth and result in inflation for an economy. The degree of these negative consequences of will depend on the initial state of the economy and rise in the UCOP.",,

EV: Different countries will adopt different policies because:
- Possible difference in state/nature of their economy
- Possible difference in appropriateness/effectiveness of policies
- Possible difference in extent of impact (negative growth vs cost-push inflation)
Suggested answer (b):
Introduction
In our analysis in part (a), countries will face a fall in national income and a rise in the general price level, both of which indicate negative performance in the economy. As such, countries will undertake policies to tackle these consequences.
Different countries may adopt different macroeconomic policies to deal with the negative consequences of a closure in international borders. This may be due to differences in the effectiveness of similar policies used or degree of these consequences.
Body
[P] A country may use expansionary demand management policies to tackle the consequences in the form of negative economic growth.
[E, E] To tackle the consequences of negative economic growth, a country may adopt expansionary fiscal policy to boost its AD. For example, a country that has a large domestic economy such as the US will experience a significant impact on its GDP when components of the AD such as C, I and G changes. This can be done via a cut in direct tax or an increase in government spending, G. A cut in personal income tax will increase the disposable income for households to boost their consumption spending, C. A cut in corporate tax will increase the post-tax profits of investments for firm to encourage more investment spending, I. The rise in C, I and G will help increase AD that bring about a positive multiplier effect to raise national income.
[EV] However, the extent of increase in C and I is dependent on the expectations of the economy in the future. If the outlook is bleak, households and firms may withhold their spending. For countries with a smaller domestic sector and where sentiments are weak, boosting C and I may not be effective to promote economic growth.
[EV] Similarly, the cut in taxes and rise in government spending may worsen the fiscal budget. Any borrowing by the government to fund its budget will result in crowding-out effect, where the rise in government borrowing to fund its rising budget deficit, lead to rise in interest rate which leads to reduction in consumption and investment, off-setting the expansion in AD that was created by the rising budget deficit. For countries with a tight fiscal budget, expansionary fiscal policy may be limited.

[E, E] An alternative policy to boost AD could be expansionary monetary policy. For example, a country like the US can do this via a reduction in the interest rate. When interest rates are cut, households may be encouraged to consume more because the opportunity cost to do so would have fallen. This is because the utility to consume is now higher than the interest payments derived from deposits. At the same time, the cost of borrowing would have also fallen. This would encourage households to borrow more to spend on big-ticket items; and firms are encouraged to invest more. This is because the MC of investment would have fallen. Since the MB is now greater than the MC, investments that were previously unattractive would now be lucrative enough for firms to take on. The rise in C and I will help increase AD that bring about a positive multiplier effect to raise national income.
[EV] Similarly, the extent of increase in C and I is dependent on the expectations of the economy in the future. If the outlook is bleak, households and firms may withhold their spending. For countries with a smaller domestic sector and where sentiments are weak, boosting C and I may not be effective to promote economic growth.
The rise in the AD, whether by expansionary fiscal or monetary policy, will lead to an unplanned fall in inventory levels that causes firms to step up on production. As the firms do so, household incomes will rise because firms now hire more workers. This rise in income will result in a rise in induced consumption that leads to a further rise in the AD. This will result in firms stepping up on production again that leads to a further rise in households’ incomes. This process will continue until total injection = total withdrawal. A new level of equilibrium national income is achieved that is a multiple of the initial rise in the AD. As such, national income rises while demand-deficient unemployment falls.
[L] Hence, expansionary demand management policies may be adopted by countries to tackle the negative economic growth and reduce demand-deficient unemployment.
[EV] Different countries may achieve a similar effect to a different extent because of the difference in the size of the multiplier. A country with a lower degree of leakages such as the US will have a stronger multiplier effect than one with high leakages such as Singapore. The heavy reliance on imports and high savings rate in Singapore will lead to higher leakage compared to the US.
[P] A country may use supply-side policies to tackle the consequences of negative economic growth and inflation
[E, E] For countries like Singapore that rely heavily on foreign workers and imported raw materials may choose to adopt supply side policies instead. This is because the rise in UCOP may be more severe than the fall in AD. In our analysis above, the rise in UCOP has resulted in negative economic growth and inflation. Supply-side policies may be used to offset the rise in UCOP, thereby reducing inflation and restoring the loss in national income from a fall in the AS.
For example, automation may be adopted to offset the reliance on Malaysian workers who are now unable to cross the border to work in Singapore. With the rises in labour productivity from adopting automation, and assuming productivity rises by more than the wage rate, unit labour cost falls. Government may also provide temporary wage relief to firms to offset the rise in wage cost. Other forms of cost reliefs could also come in the form of temporary tax holidays. Such supply-side policies will lead to an increase in the AS for an economy because it is now cheaper to produce the same units of output. The resulting downward shift in the horizontal portion of the AS curve due to a fall in UCOP will lead to a movement along the AD curve. Hence, national output rises when GPL falls.
[L] Hence, a country that suffers the effects of cost-push inflation to a larger degree may adopt supply-side policies to tackle the consequences of a border closure.

[EV] For a country that was initially suffering from demand-pull inflation, the fall in AD caused by the closure of international borders would actually be beneficial for them. Hence, such a country would most likely choose to adopt supply-side policies that will shift the vertical AS rightwards instead because it helps to reduce the rise in GPL and leads to a rise in national income to better target the root cause of the cost-push inflation.
Conclusion/Evaluation
[Stand] The effectiveness of the policies adopted by different governments hinges very much on the problem(s) created by the closure of international borders (which is partly dependent on the initial state of the economy), the nature of their economies and the mix of policies that are adopted by the governments.
[Substantiation]
The initial state of the economy may determine whether a country would choose to adopt supply-side policy or demand-management policies. If the economy was initially suffering from demand-pull inflation, the fall in AD from the closure of international borders helps to reduce the problem; and the use of supply-side policies would be more effective to generate actual growth and lower inflation.
The extent / type of problems created the closure of international borders determines to a large extent what policies a government chooses. For some countries, the effects of rise in UCOP may be more severe than fall in AD because of the nature and their initial state of the economy. In this case, the use of supply-side policies will better target the root cause (horizontal vs vertical portion of AS) of their problem more effectively. For example, a country like Singapore that relies on imported raw materials and foreign labour, she should adopt short-term supply-side policies to mitigate the rise in UCOP.
In addition, for a smaller country like Singapore, the use of fiscal policy to address the recession caused by border closure might not be as effective as in the US. This is because although Singapore does not face a crowding-out effect, she has a smaller domestic market and a much smaller multiplier size due to her high MPS and MPM. Thus, besides expansionary fiscal policy, Singapore also uses supply-side policy like wage subsidy to generate actual growth. On the other hand, a big and less open economy like US could use fiscal policy but will face the issue of crowding-out effect. Hence, to boost the effectiveness of demand management policies, the country tends to also use expansionary monetary policy like interest rate cuts.
A country like the US could also use wage subsidy, but the scope of its use would be more limited compared to Singapore, given its lack of fiscal reserves.",,
"Monetary policy - generally conducted by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) or the European Central Bank (ECB) - is a policy tool for achieving low inflation and economic growth.
(a) Explain the economic consequences when central banks are unable to achieve low
inflation. [10]","Introduction
Inflation is a situation where there is a sustained increase in the general price level (GPL) of an economy. Central banks around the world usually aim for a low inflation rate of about 2%. This is the main objective of central banks as this low rate is associated with good economic performance in an economy. Higher or negative rates of inflation usually leads to problems that imposes various costs to the economy.
Body
[P] High inflation rate leads to price instability and creates uncertainty for businesses and discourages investments as well as worsens price competitiveness of the country’s exports leading to a fall in economic growth.
[E] In order for firms to undertake investments, they need to be assured of the profitability of their investments, which would entail them being able to accurately forecast their expected revenues and cost incurred in producing goods and services and hence profits. Having a high inflation rate would result in the price signals provided by the market being distorted and this uncertainty would make it difficult for businesses to plan for their future needs. In addition, an economy experiencing high inflation could indicate the economy is not doing well and decrease firms’ business confidence and hence their expected rates of returns on investments. Thus, investments will be discouraged leading to a decrease in AD which not only leads to a multiplied decrease in real NY and lower levels of employment via the multiplier effect but also negative potential growth in the economy, if the rate of capital accumulation is less than the capital depreciation rate. This will worsen the actual and potential economic growth performance of the country.
[E] When a country has a high inflation rate compared to their trading partners, this will mean that prices of the country’s exports would become less price competitive in the world markets leading to a lower quantity demanded by foreigners and a decrease in the export revenue. In addition, locally produced goods are now relatively more expensive compared to imports leading to a rise in import expenditure, as residents switch to foreign goods instead of consuming the relatively more expensive domestic goods. This increase in M and fall in X due to a rise in the GPL will lead to decreases in real national income and hence negative economic growth through the international substitution (NOTE to students: This is a movement along AD because it is a response to a change in GPL).
[L] Therefore, not being able to maintain a low inflation rate discourages investment and exports needed for economic growth in an economy.
[P] Low inflation is needed in order to allow the market to allocate resources efficiently and prevent the wastage of resources such that society’s welfare can be maximised.

[E] When inflation becomes too high and/or rising, prices no longer change in a predictable manner. When the price of a good increases a producer is unable to clearly determine if the price increase is indeed due to an underlying increase in consumer preference and hence demand for that product. He may choose to allocate more resources to the production of that good, but it may be the case that consumer demand has not increased at all. This will lead to an inefficient allocation of resources because increasing production level of the good causes the output level to reach a point where the MB of consuming the good will be less than MC of producing it, resulting in welfare loss for society. Due to scarcity, it is important that resources be allocated in a way which maximises society’s welfare, i.e. one whereby allocative efficiency is attained. In a market economy, price signals are the mechanism by which it is attained – higher prices indicate rising consumer preference for the good – and hence resources should be allocated to fulfill consumers desire for the good, just as falling prices signal to producers to allocate less resources to the good. Hence with the distortion of the price mechanism because of high inflation, society’s welfare will not be maximised.
[E] In addition, high inflation would also impose menu costs on an economy as business would have to constantly have to decide on new prices, change price labels and print new menus or catalogs when prices change. When there is high inflation (e.g. hyperinflation), firms will see such costs rise rapidly as they have to change prices very often to keep up with all other prices in the economy. This would lead to a wastage of resources that could have been used for other purposes that could contribute to a higher economic well-being of society.
[L] Therefore, maintaining a low inflation rate can prevent inefficiencies arising from price instability.
[P] A high inflation rate makes it harder to maintain the SOL of the country’s residents/lead to the SOL falling.
[E] Inflation reduces the internal value of money. When inflation is high and nominal wages remains constant or rises less than the inflation rate, the purchasing power of workers and hence households will fall as they are able to purchase less goods and services with the real incomes they receive. This usually applies to casual workers whose wage rates are not indexed. Inflation thus reduces their material SOL of such residents.
[E] In addition, if inflation is high, then the real interest rate would be lower as the real interest rate is given by nominal interest rate minus inflation rate. A high inflation rate would disadvantage savers, as the real returns on savings would become lower. This may be of particular concern for retirees who are living off their savings or are drawing a fixed income from pensions or retirement funds, hence their material SOL would be lowered. Conversely, if there is deflation, then the real interest rate would be higher, which would disadvantage borrowers as the real burden of debt is increased. This would adversely impact young home buyers who may be borrowing to finance their purchase, with the increased real burden of debt meaning that more consumption would have to be sacrificed to repay the interest in real terms, causing a decline in material SOL.
[L] Therefore, a high inflation rate would worsen the SOL of various residents in a country.",,
(b) Assess the likely impact on the living standards of Singapore residents when the US central bank cuts interest rate. [15],"
[R1] US central bank cutting interest rates will positively affect SOL in Singapore [R2] US central bank cutting interest rates will negatively affect SOL in Singapore
Introduction
Interest rates are monetary policy tools used by central banks to achieve a country’s macroeconomic goals. A country’s living standards refers to the material and non-material well-being of its residents. Material well-being stems from the consumption of goods and services, while non-material well-being stems from the intangibles, such as the state of the environment, amount of leisure time, etc.
Body
[R1] US central bank cutting interest rates will positively affect material and non-material SOL in Singapore
[P] A cut in US interest rates will result in higher economic growth for Singapore.
[E] With the US central bank cuts the interest rates, the cost of borrowing will fall for both US consumers and firms. Consumers will find it cheaper to borrow to purchase durable goods and services. In addition, as they receive lower returns to their savings from banks, the opportunity cost of spending decreases. This will lead to a fall in savings and together there will be a rise in consumption expenditure. For firms, if expected rate of returns remain the same, the lower cost of borrowing will mean a lower marginal cost of investments, leading to investment projects that were unprofitable in the past to be profitable now. Hence this leads to a rise in Investment expenditure (I) as there is more incentive to expand firm capacity. A rise in C and I will cause AD to increase.
[E] As AD rises from AD0 to AD1, AD exceeds output. US firms will experience an unplanned fall in inventories which will signal to them to step up production and demand for more factors of production (e.g. labour) in order to produce more (Y0 to Y1). As output and income increase, households will spend a portion of their income increase on domestically
  
produced goods and services, causing AD to rise further to AD2. At the same time, households save a part of their increased income, pay more taxes and spend on imports, causing withdrawals to increase. Since the spending by one is income for another, the cycle continues until withdrawals once more equate injections. Assuming there is spare capacity in the economy, these successive rounds of spending lead to multiplied increase in national income for the US from Y0 to Y2.

[E] As NY rises in the US, US households will have greater purchasing power and will likely increase their demand for imports since import is a function of income. This will benefit Singapore as some of this increase will be for exported goods from Singapore. As Singapore sees a rise in (X-M), this will in turn lead to a rise in AD. Similar to what was explained earlier, Singapore firms will also experience an unplanned fall in inventories which will signal to them to step up production and demand for more factors of production (e.g. labour) in order to produce more. As output and income increase, households will spend a portion of their income increase on domestically produced goods and services, causing AD to rise further and the cycle to repeat. Hence, demand-deficient unemployment will fall and there will be a multiplied increase in national income an actual economic growth. Assuming that the population level stays the same, the real GDP per capita in Singapore should rise and this will result in greater purchasing power to buy goods and services for the satisfaction of their wants and needs. This will lead to an increase in their material living standards.
[E] In addition, the increased economic activity and higher income levels will lead to increases in tax revenue collected by the Singapore government from direct taxes such as income and corporate tax as well as indirect taxes such as the goods and services tax. This will increase the government’s ability to spend on items that contribute to households’ material and non-material SOL e.g. increase spending on health care, education and various social amenities, as well as green technologies to reduce pollution levels.
[L] Thus, the higher Economic Growth in Singapore because of the cuts in US Interest Rates will lead to an increase in both material and non-material SOL of Singapore residents.
[Ev] The extent of increase in X revenue for Singapore from the interest rate cuts depend on consumer and business confidence in the US. If consumers and firms are generally pessimistic, then the interest rate cuts are unlikely to cause C and I to rise significantly, thereby limiting the increase in national income in the US. This means that the impact on Singapore’s economy might be limited as the level of X will not increase significantly.
[Possible alternative EV] Lower interest rates in the US might result in hot money (short term capital) outflows that will cause the US$ to depreciate (SGD gets stronger) as SS of US$ increases in the currency markets. This may cause goods and services from the US to

be relatively cheaper in terms of Singapore dollars and so Singapore may increase quantity demanded for imports from the US. If demand for the imports is price elastic, it will result in a rise in M. Furthermore, the weaker USD would cause exports from Singapore to be relatively more expensive in USD, causing US consumers to demand less of Singapore’s exports. This may lead to a fall in X. The fall in X-M and AD (If more significant than the initial change due to higher national income in US) will negatively impact Singapore’s actual growth and cause a rise in demand-deficient unemployment. This would lead to a fall in SOL as these workers are unable to purchase as many goods and service as before. (or offset some of the initial gains from the initial increase in AD)
(*Possible indirect positive impacts to consider)
When the US central cut interest rates, Singapore’s interest rates will fall too due to Singapore being an interest rate taker. So, consumption and investment levels in Singapore might also rise leading to an increase in AD and subsequently higher AG and PG which improves the SOL.
Higher EG in US could lead to better business confidence of firms/global outlook since it’s the world’s largest economy and result in increase FDI (especially in high tech/clean energy industries) to Singapore which will help AG and PG leading to higher SOL.
[R2] US central bank cutting interest rates will negatively affect material and non-material SOL in Singapore
[P] US interest rate cuts may increase inflationary pressures in Singapore.
[E, E] If the Singapore economy is operating near full employment, the rise in AD from the higher export revenue will result in a rise in the general price level (GPL) and greater demand-pull inflationary pressures. This is because when output is increased, the resulting fall in unemployment means that firms are less able to get the resources that they need, resulting in less efficient factor combinations and rising unit cost of production. Hence, firms are only willing to sell their output at higher prices. The increase in general price level will lead to a rise in the cost of living for the residents in the country.
[L] Assuming the average household’s nominal income rises more slowly than the GPL or remains unchanged, there will be a fall in its real income, that is, a fall in the amount of goods and services that households can consume resulting in a lower material standard of living.
[P] The rise in economic activity from a cut in US interest rates could lead to a fall in non-material SOL in Singapore
[E] The higher demand for Singapore exports from the US will mean firms in Singapore will likely increase their production of goods and services. This increase in economic activity will likely result in increased negative externalities caused by pollution from factories as well as transportation services (cars and trucks) as firms and consumers in their pursuit of self-interest will only consider private marginal benefits in their decision making and will not bother to internalize the negative externalities by reducing the pollution created by their production activities. The pollution could lead to a fall in the air quality and the increase production of transport services lead to an increase in level of traffic congestions in the country resulting in a lower quality of life as the health of the residents are adversely affected.
[E] In addition, rising economic activities would usually be accompanied by rising working hours that would affect the amount of time workers have for rest and other leisure activities. This is because, in the short run, firms will not be able to increases its fixed factor (e.g. factor building) to increase its output and would likely resort to increase output by getting their employees to longer hours each day. This longer working hours and pressure to meet higher production levels would also increase the stress level of workers and adversely affect their mental health and quality of life.
[L] The worsening of the quality of life would result in a fall in the non-material SOL.

Conclusion
[Stand] In conclusion, although there could be both positive and/or negative impacts on the living standards of Singapore residents when the US central bank cuts interest rate, given the nature of the Singapore economy, the overall impact would likely be positive. [Substantiation] Due to the small and open nature of the Singapore economy, a rise in (X-M) is likely to increase her AD and thus income significantly, as X takes up a large proportion of Singapore’s GDP. Even though the change in income levels for the US due to the interest cuts might not be large, the fact that US is one of the top export destinations for Singapore would mean that even a slight increase could lead to a substantial rise in X from Singapore. This would result in a rise in Singapore’s EG and thus SOL of its residents. (Furthermore, the possible fall in Singapore’s interest rate could also further increase AD due to increases in C and I)
Although there might be the potential of inflationary pressures, given the current economic state in Singapore, it is unlikely that will be a significant lack of spare capacity. In addition, the cut in interest rates in US might lead to an inflow of short-term capital (hot money) from US to Singapore leading to an appreciation of the SGD (fall in the value of the USD) and a fall in the prices on imported factors inputs (which are all priced in USD) for Singapore. This will help reduce imported inflation and offset any possible demand-pull inflationary pressures. The possible non-material issues such as higher pollution levels due to the higher levels of economic activity are also unlikely to have any major negative impact in Singapore given the structure of the export sector as well as various government policies that are already in place. Unlike many countries which rely on more pollutive methods of production, Singapore firms tend to use less pollutive methods given the high tech/value exports that is produced as well as the stringent environmental regulations that are strictly enforced. Thus, the cutting of interest rates by the US central bank would result in an increased in SOL of Singapore residents.",,

Introduction
Comparative advantage is the ability of a country to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost compared to other countries. Based on the theory of Comparative Advantage (CA), a country can benefit from trade by specialising in the production of a good or service that it has CA in, and then export the good for which is has CA in production and importing the good that it has comparative disadvantage in producing. While the theory does assume that a country’s CA is inherent in the factor endowment which is rather static, CA patterns can indeed change in the real world with different factors involved.

[P] The main source of CA is the country’s factor endowment, hence changing CA can be due to changes in factor endowment.
[E,E] Changes in a country’s factor endowment may be due to intensive usage of its natural resources.
One example could be for countries that have abundant mineral resources such that the opportunity cost of extraction might be lower, and thus have a CA in production of minerals like coal or copper. Over time, as these resources are mined, the resources are depleted, thus diminishing the factor endowment of the country, and leading to a rise in opportunity cost of producing the raw material such that it could become higher than another country’s opportunity cost of production, resulting in a loss of CA.
Another example of changing factor endowment can be seen in China. The relative abundance of cheap labour in China in the past allowed China to specialise in labour intensive production and export their goods, incurring lower opportunity cost compared to other countries. However, China is gradually losing CA in labour intensive goods as heightened demand together with slower population growth has led to reduction in the abundance of labour in China, increasing the opportunity cost of labour-intensive industries and this has eroded China’s CA. Instead, production of labour-intensive goods like textiles has started to shift to other countries such as Vietnam, where there is greater relative abundance of low-cost labour.
[L] Hence changing factor endowment would lead to changing comparative advantage.

[P] A reason for a country to develop new areas of CA is through higher levels of investment and R&D, possibly with government support.
[E,E] For example, Singapore has been shifting into new areas of CA actively to avoid close competition with other global manufacturers with lower cost. Singapore has been shifting its focus away from electronics and instead to pharmaceutical and biomedical products. The Singapore government has provided infrastructure, for example the development of the Biopolis and the Tuas Biomedical Park and accompanying this were tax breaks and business incentives to attract foreign direct investments and R&D in the pharmaceutical sector. The higher level of investment will allow greater utilisation of new medical and production technologies which will help to lower opportunity cost in production and thus allow Singapore to gain CA in this area. By creating biomedical and pharma ‘hubs’, these sectors can also reap economies of scale through larger output, and which will further enhance CA in such products.
In the diagram below, Singapore initially has CA over Australia in producing electronics as she possesses the appropriate skilled labour and capital, as shown by PPC1 while she has a comparative disadvantage in producing pharmaceutical drugs. Over time, as Singapore focuses its capabilities development on pharmaceutical industries by investing in human capital, the opportunity cost of producing pharmaceuticals becomes lower than Australia PPC2 where Singapore now has a CA in producing pharmaceuticals. This is represented by SG’s PPC now having a gentler slope compared to Australia’s PPC.

Note– The diagrammatic representation is not critical for this answer. What is important to score for analytical explanation is to show understanding that when technology improves and/or capital is accumulated for one type of production (good X), lesser units of resources are now needed to produce it, such that the opportunity cost of producing it falls. And if the opportunity cost falls to a point that it becomes lower than another country, this country now has the CA in producing good X.
[P] Given the improvement in factor mobility across international borders, a country can develop new areas of CA by bringing in foreign resources.
[E,E] With globalisation, capital controls have been reduced. Countries can attract FDI by MNCs. The host country is thus able to accumulate capital and acquire the know how to produce certain goods at much reduced opportunity cost, causing them to acquire CA on production. For example, SG acquisition of CA in pharmaceutical drugs is not only due to

"(b) Discuss the extent to which the measures adopted by the Singapore government
aimed at increasing global competitiveness might cause difficulties for its economy.","
Introduction
The global competitiveness of an economy can be measured by price & quality (non-price) competitiveness of its products, to improve on these aspects, a combination of demand management and supply side policies can be used. However, these policies options might cause significant trade-offs within the Singapore’s economy.
Body
[P] Free trade agreements used to increase Singapore’s price competitiveness might bring about structural unemployment in Singapore.
[E, E] Singapore focuses on exporting goods and services in which she has comparative advantage such as pharmaceutical and financial services. With lower opportunity cost in producing these goods and services, Singapore has price competitiveness in selling these products in global markets. To promote her exports competitiveness further, Singapore has signed Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with countries such as Europe and USA. She is also a member of the ASEAN Free Trade area. These free trade agreements will eliminate tariff barriers amongst member countries and will help to make Singapore’s exports cheaper when sold in the markets of member countries, increasing Singapore’s price competitiveness.
The forging of FTAs could also attract FDI from MNCs into Singapore. For example, an MNC from a non-ASEAN country with no FTA with ASEAN may wish to set up production plants in Singapore so that it can export from Singapore to other ASEAN countries, to take advantage of the waiver of import tariffs by other ASEAN countries when the good is exported from Singapore due to the ASEAN FTA.
[E, E] However, this will expose Singaporean firms to a higher level of international or regional competition. For Singapore, the forging of FTA could lead to removal of non-tariff barriers that lead to entry of foreign firms that supply services, into the Singapore market. Hence, industries which do not have the comparative advantage against similar industries in economies of the FTA or face a competitive disadvantage against foreign firms in the country, might face a reduction in their demand and the eventual need to reduce their demand for labour. These workers who are then unemployed might not have the skillset for other industries, leading them being structurally unemployed.
[L] Hence, while FTAs can bring about an improvement in price competitiveness of export for Singapore, it can also cause difficulties in term of structural unemployment.
[P] Supply-side policies such as the promotion of process innovation to improve price competitiveness might cause structural unemployment and the widening of the income gap.
[E,E] Singapore focuses on exporting goods and services in which she has comparative advantage such as pharmaceutical and financial services. With lower opportunity cost in producing these goods and services, Singapore has price competitiveness in selling these products in global markets. To promote her exports competitiveness further, Singapore has employed supply side policies such as the Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) by Enterprise Singapore. The grant subsidises firms to improve on their processes or to encourage adoption of automation to reduce the unit cost of production. While this will improve the price competitiveness of Singapore’s export, it might cause workers whose jobs

are made redundant due to the increased automation of firms’ processes. If these retrenched workers lack the relevant skill sets needed to manage the automated tasks or are unable to gain employment further up the value-chain, there will be an increase in structural employment, [L] causing difficulties for Singapore’s economy. There will be people who can’t find alternative jobs due to the lack of relevant skills. Moreover, those who have relevant skills that match the country’s drive towards automation will enjoy rising wages. [L] Thus, the distribution of income in the country becomes more unequal.
[P] A low tax rate and building a well-connected infrastructure to attract FDI might lead to a worsening of the Singapore government budget position rising inequity.
[E,E] To build up a high level of attractiveness to foreign investors, Singapore maintains low business costs, a ready pool of skilled labour, and quality infrastructure for business operations. To attract investments, Singapore has a low corporate tax rate, and ensures ease of doing business through simplifying administrative processes and facilitating investments via government agencies like the Economic Development Board. Supporting the build-up of required infrastructure, including stable and affordable electricity and water supplies, also helps attract foreign businesses to set up operations in Singapore as having strong infrastructure networks helps to lower cost of production for firms. However, the fiscal spending to achieve these infrastructure projects are significant and prolonged. A low corporate tax environment might limit the fiscal budget the government can raise to finance such spending. In order to ensure a sufficient fiscal budget, the government might explore alternative tax revenue streams such as increasing the Goods and Service Tax (GST). As an indirect tax, it places a larger tax burden on lower income families as the tax will take up a larger proportion of their income, [L] resulting in greater inequity Singapore.
[Ev] While there are efforts to mitigate some of these effects by providing transfer payments such as the annual GST vouchers, Singapore faces a shrinking labour pool from an ageing population and in turn a shrinking tax pool by the government. Hence, the government will need to rely on increasing indirect taxes to finance its spending to improve global competitiveness. Over the long run, this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on lower income families in the economy. But this can be reduced via transfer payments targeted at poorer households, to off-set the effects of GST.
Conclusion
[Stand] Measures used by the Singapore government to improve global competitiveness will
cause difficulties to a limited extent.
[Substantiation] Given Singapore’s trade dependent nature and small domestic economy, measures that improves its global competitiveness can bring about significant macroeconomic benefits in terms of growth and employment. Furthermore, the extent of the difficulties caused by the policies can be determined by the nature of the chosen policies to improve global competitiveness. Policies that aim to improve the skills of the labour force should lead to a limited conflict as it can bring about inclusive growth while improving Singapore’s BOT. However, policies such as FTAs and the promotion of process innovation, on their own, can lead to improvement in competitiveness while causing structural unemployment.
Overall, the difficulties from the measures employed by the Singapore government will generally be limited. This is because the government can consider using a right mix of policies such as the promotion of process innovation while retraining workers in the relevant skills to minimise the structural unemployment that arises from the former.

"The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a global recession and lockdowns. Many people had sought to improve their mood during lockdowns by enjoying a cup of coffee. On the other hand, prices of coffee beans rose sharply due to rising freight costs and dry weather in Brazil, one of the world’s largest producers of coffee beans.
Source: Various
(a) Explain the supply and demand factors that could have led to the sharp rise in price of coffee beans. [10]","Introduction:
Define market mechanism:
The market mechanism works through the interaction of the market forces of demand and supply to determine the equilibrium price of coffee beans.
Definitions of key economic terms
• The demand for coffee refers to the quantity of coffee that consumers are willing and able to consume in a given period of time at various prices.
• The supply for coffee refers to the quantity of coffee that the producers are willing and able to offer to sale in a given period of time at various prices.
    
Using the market adjustment process, explain how the changes in demand and
supply impacts the equilibrium price (Explanation of DD-SS diagram):
• [Initial equilibrium] Initially, the market is in equilibrium at E1 at the intersection of demand (D1) and supply (S1). The initial equilibrium price and quantity is at P1 and Q1
 
respectively.
• [Identify and explain the shifts]:
o [Demand Factor]: Global recession due to COVID-19 pandemic→fall in income→fall in purchasing power→fall in demand for coffee, assuming that coffee is a normal good. As cocoa bean is a factor input used to produce coffee, the demand for cocoa bean is derived from the demand of coffee. Hence, a fall in demand for coffee → fall in demand for coffee beans. OR “Many people had sought to improve their mood during lockdowns by enjoying a cup of coffee” → change in taste and preference in favour of coffee → increase in demand for coffee. As cocoa bean is a factor input used to produce coffee, the demand for cocoa bean is derived from the demand of coffee. Hence, an increase in demand for coffee → increase in demand for coffee beans.
o [Supply Factor]: Rising freight costs → increases the unit cost of production →lower potential profit per unit→fall in supply for coffee beans. OR Dry weather in Brazil → fall in supply as the production process is disrupted.
• [*Make a judgement on the relative magnitude of the shifts] + Draw Diagram

The fall in supply is greater than the fall in demand as there is a sharp rise in price of coffee beans as seen in Figure 1. This could be because freight costs account a significant proportion of the costs of producing coffee beans./This could be because the dry weather affected Brazil which is major producer of coffee beans in the world. Also, as coffee could be a necessity for most people, the 0<YED<1, this means that for a given fall in income, there would only be a less than proportionate fall in demand for coffee and hence coffee beans.
• [Identify the shortage/surplus] At the original price level P1, as the fall in supply is greater than the fall in demand will create a shortage of QsQd as quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied.
• [Identify the change in price] This exerts an upwards pressure on prices as buyers offer higher prices for the limited supply. As price rises, quantity demanded falls while quantity supplied rises. This continues until the shortage is completely eliminated at the new equilibrium E2.

• [State the new (final) equilibrium] A fall in demand results in a decrease in price. A fall in supply results in an increase in price. Hence, the impact on equilibrium price is indeterminate. As the fall in supply is greater than the fall in demand, equilibrium price will increase to P2.
Use a relevant elasticity concept to address the question on “sharp rise in the price of coffee beans”:
• Demand for coffee beans is likely to be price inelastic with PED<1 due to the lack of substitutes for coffee beans. It is an essential factor input used in the production of coffee. Hence, for a fall in supply, there would be a sharp rise in price of coffee beans.
• Supply for coffee beans is likely to be price inelastic with PES<1 in the short run. This is because it takes time for coffee plants to grow and to harvest the coffee beans. Hence, for a rise in demand, there would be a sharp rise in price of coffee beans.
Conclusion:
Fall in supply due to rising freight costs and bad weather in Brazil, accompanied with demand that is price inelastic would explain the sharp rise in price of coffee beans.

(b) Assess the significance of different elasticities of demand in explaining the impact of the above events on the revenue earned by producers of different types of coffee beverages. [15],"Introduction
Total revenue refers to the product of price and quantity of a good. The revenue earned by both producers of coffee beverages and other related goods are directly or indirectly affected by changes in the price of coffee beans and the concepts of PED, YED and XED will be significant in explaining the likely effects on revenue due to the sharp rise in price of coffee beans.
Development 1:
Thesis: PED is significant in explaining the impact of the above events on the revenue earned by producers of different types of coffee beverages
• [Explain the impact of a sharp rise in price of coffee beans on the SS of coffee beverages] Since coffee beans are factors of production for coffee beverages, the sharp rise in price of coffee beans → increase in unit cost of production for coffee beverages→potential profits per unit falls→profit motivated producers will cut down on production of coffee beverages at every price → fall in supply of coffee beverages → lead to an increase in equilibrium price and a fall in equilibrium quantity for coffee beverages. The change in total revenue is dependent on the relative changes in price and quantity which can be determined by the price elasticity of demand.
• [Define PED] Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded of a good to a change in the price of the good itself, ceteris paribus.
• [Explain the PED value] The numerical sign of the price elasticity of demand is negative due to the inverse relationship between the price and quantity demanded of the good.

[PED>1] Demand for coffee beverages sold at Hawker Centre is price elastic due to availability of close substitutes as there is highly likely to be other stalls selling similar coffee beverages in the Hawker Centre or at Food Court nearby. Consumers are very responsive to price increase as they can easily switch to purchasing other readily available substitutes. This means that a given increase in the price of coffee beverages → there will be a more than proportionate fall in the quantity demanded, ceteris paribus. Thus, the increase in total revenue due to increase in price (Area A) is less than the decrease in total revenue due to the fall in quantity demanded (Area B) as seen in Figure 2. Overall, total revenue will decrease.
o [PED<1]: The demand for artisanal coffee could be price inelastic due to the lack of close substitutes. For example, Apartment Coffee’s coffee beverages not only sell unique coffee beverages but also provide a unique experience for the consumers. Consumers get to watch the baristas in action and interact with them over a cup of coffee. This means that for a given increase in the price of coffee beverages, there will be a less than proportionate fall in the quantity demanded, ceteris paribus. Thus, the increase in total revenue due to increase in price is greater than the decrease in total revenue due to the fall in quantity demanded. Overall, total revenue will increase.
• [Link back to question] Hence, PED is significant in determining changes in total revenue for producers of different types of coffee beverages.
Anti-thesis: PED is not significant in explaining the impact of the above events on the revenue earned by producers of different types of coffee beverages
• PED is not significant in explaining the impact of the above events on the revenue earned by producers of coffee beverages if demand factors are more significant than supply factors in explaining the rise in price of coffee beverages.
• For example, there could be a large change in taste and preference towards coffee during the COVID-19 pandemic.
• OR
• For example, for luxurious coffee such as Bacha coffee beverage, a fall in income
would lead to a more than proportionate fall in demand for Bacha coffee beverage. Hence, demand factor and hence YED may place a more significant factor in explaining the impact on total revenue than PED.
Development 2:
Thesis: YED is significant in explaining the impact of the above events on the revenue earned by producers of different types of coffee beverages
*Students need to note that their depth of elaboration would depend on whether they have explained how a change in income impacts demand of coffee in (a).
• As there is a global recession due to COVID-19 leading to a fall in income, YED is significant in explaining the impact on the revenue earned by producers of different types of coffee beverages.

 [Define YED] Income elasticity of demand (YED) measures the degree of responsiveness of demand of a good to a change in income, ceteris paribus.
• [Explain the YED value] The numerical value of income elasticity of demand may be positive or negative.
o Inferior goods have negative income elasticity of demand. For example, coffee beverages sold in hawker food centres. Hence, with the global recession due to COVID-19, as income decreases the demand for the coffee beverages sold in hawker food centres increases, ceteris paribus. Hence, for hawker food sellers who sell coffee beverages they may experience an increase in total revenue or a smaller fall in total revenue.
o On the other hand, coffee beverages such as Starbucks or Bacha coffee beverages are considered as normal goods with positive income elasticity of demand i.e. as income decreases the demand for the good decreases, ceteris paribus.
▪ [YED>1] For Bacha coffee beverages that are known for its hand- roasted beans, bespoke grinds and elegant service, which are deemed as a luxury good, YED>1 and demand is income elastic. Hence with recession and a fall in income, there will be a more than proportionate decrease in the demand of the good. Hence, for producers of Bacha coffee beverages they will experience a large fall in total revenue.
▪ [YED<1] For Starbucks coffee beverages which are deemed with a higher degree of necessity, YED<1 and demand is income inelastic. Hence with a recession and a fall in income, there will be a less than proportionate decrease in the demand of the good. Hence, for producers of Starbucks coffee beverages they will experience a smaller fall in total revenue.
Anti-thesis: YED is not significant in explaining the impact of the above events on the revenue earned by producers of coffee beverages
• YED is not significant in explaining the impact on the revenue earned by producers of coffee beverages as income factor is not the most significant factor that influences demand for coffee.
• There could be other more significant factors influencing the demand for coffee beverages.
• Example: One of the major drivers of demand in the coffee beverage market is the rising popularity of coffee among the millennials. This means that change in taste and preference in favour of coffee beverages could be a more significant factor affected demand and hence total revenue earned by producers of coffee beverages. Hence, YED is not a significant in explaining the impact on total revenue.

Development 3:
XED is not significant in explaining the impact of the above events on the revenue earned by producers of different types of coffee beverages
• [Define XED] Cross elasticity of demand (XED) of other beverages with respect to the price of coffee beverages measures the degree of responsiveness of demand of another beverage to a change in the price of coffee beverages, ceteris paribus.
• XED is not significant in explaining the impact of the above events on the revenue earned by producers of different types of coffee beverages as coffee beans are factor inputs used in the production of coffee beverages for all producers.
Conclusion/Synthesis:
[Criterion: Factors affecting change in demand and supply/time period] The significance of the different elasticities of demand is dependent on the factors affecting the change in demand and supply. If the main reason for the change in price of coffee beverages is due to change in price of coffee beans, PED is the most significant factor in the short run. As coffee beans take up a large proportion of the cost to produce coffee beverages, PED of coffee beverages is most relevant in showing the effects a decrease in supply of coffee beverages on total revenue of producers of coffee beverages in the short run. Over time, the impact of production disruptions and rising freight costs may be reduced as countries revert to normalcy with more flights and better management of COVID-19 situation and coffee beans farmers adopting more efficient methods of production/more resilient coffee beans. Thus, PED may be less significant in the long run. If the change in price of coffee beverages is largely due to a change in income, then YED is the most significant factor.
[Criterion: Extent of problems in the use of elasticity concepts] However, in reality, elasticity data may not be accurately computed. In addition, internal changes (e.g., coffee beans farmers or coffee beverages producers learn more cost-effective methods of production) or changes to the firm’s external environment (e.g., more substitutes to the firm’s products appear in the market) may occur. Therefore, such data may also change from time to time, making it harder to rely upon and therefore less significant to determine the changes in total revenue. Moreover, ceteris paribus assumption may not hold in reality. The impact on total revenue is also dependent on a variety of factors such as changes in demand (e.g., due to changes in health trends) and changes in supply (e.g., due to firm strategies).",,

possibility of producing goods on demand via
Adapted from: www.investopedia.com, 23 Jan 2022

(a) Using economic theory, explain how the market structure in which online streaming giants such as Netflix operate would influence the way firms compete. [10]","Introduction:
[15]
  To consider the market structure which best describes the characteristics of the online streaming market in Singapore, we would need to look at the number and size of firms (market share of the firms), nature of product, barriers to entry, their ability to set prices and the presence of long-term profits of these firms.
Development: The oligopolistic industry describes the characteristics of the online streaming industry.
An oligopoly has few large firms dominating market with high barriers to entry that deters entrants and this could explain how each firm would have significant market share. The online streaming industry is hence likely to be an oligopoly based on the market share/market concentration ratio where the largest 5 firms account for more than 50% of the market share and that implies that there are substantial barriers to entry. For instance, HBO Max has 12% of the streaming share in the United States, while Hulu and Disney+ (both owned by Disney) dominate 13% market share each. Amazon Prime Video comes in second with 19% share. Netflix remains in first place with 25%.
There are high barriers to entry to in the online streaming industry telco. Barriers to entry are anything that prevent the entry of new firms into an industry, thereby limiting the amount of competition faced by existing firm. An example will be financial barriers to entry which comprises high start up costs. For instance, to deliver streaming services, these firms need to ensure that the technical and satellite infrastructure is set up to ensure that the streaming is seamlessly transmitted. There are also legal barriers such as the need to obtain license to stream and the complexity could differ depending on the country and governance. Furthermore, there are firm-created barriers where new firms will need to incur substantial amount of advertising funds for brand establishment so as to differentiate

themselves from the incumbents. These barriers to entry may deter new firms from entering the industry.
The high barriers to entry result in the market dominated by a few large firms like Netflix, Disney+. With significant market share, these firms possessed high market power with the ability to set prices where they would be able to restrict output to raise price. This small number of firms reduces the substitutability of the products of each firm hence they each face a steep downward sloping demand curve where the PED value is highly price- inelastic.
Development 1: Explain how the market structure (characteristic of mutual interdependence) would influence the way firms compete in terms of pricing decisions.
1. Collusive behaviour [Explicit collusion]
The small number of firms would result in the action of one firm having significant effect on its rivals hence they are mutually interdependent. The online streaming industry can either compete or collude. Their behaviour will affect the pricing decisions of the firms. If the firms in the industry collude, they will act like a monopoly and set prices and output at profit maximizing level where MC (marginal cost) =MR (marginal revenue), and where MC cuts MR from below. As such, demand is relatively price inelastic (oligopolistic market structure), the demand curve would be downward sloping and the firm is able to charge a higher price, P1. The firm maximises its profits at Q1 because at any other level of output, it can adjust its level of production to increase profits further. It is only at Q1 where MC = MR that it maximises its profits as it cannot adjust its production level in any way to increase its profits further. Therefore, the firm’s output will be Q1, and price would be P1, derived from the demand curve when output is Q1.

Another example of collusion is the price leadership model. When costs continue to rise throughout the market, prices must rise too. Pressure will build up within the industry for a price change, but each individual firm will be reluctant to be the first to raise the price. Each firm will fear the loss of its consumers if other firms do not follow the price increase.
Often the other firms in the industry look to one leading firm to make the first move. This firm is called the price leader. Firms in the oligopoly will follow the pricing decisions of the firm chosen to be the price leader. Generally, firms do not get together and agree to follow the leader; the practice develops over the course of time.
The price leader can set its price (as if it were a monopoly), at a point that maximises its own profits. Other firms, which individually could have little influence over the price anyway, would take the price set by the dominant firm as given and produce accordingly (based on their individual cost curves). Thus, the leader will initiate price changes which will then be followed by all the other firms in the oligopoly.
3. Competitive pricing behaviour
The competitive oligopolist is likely to face a kinked demand curve. The price and output of the oligopolist is predetermined at the kink. As there is a high level of mutual interdependence, each oligopolist assumes that its rival would match any price decreases it makes but not follow it in any price increase. This is because if a firm reduces its price, rivals will follow suit to match the price cut to prevent losing customers to the first firm. If the firm increases its price, rivals will not follow suit since by doing so they can expect a gain of customers from the first firm.
Therefore, an increase in price from OP to OP1 causes a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded as the oligopolies is likely lose a large number of consumers, Q to Q1 to its rivals. The cut in price will brings about a less than proportionate increase in quantity demanded from Q to Q2. As a result, prices tend to stay rigid at P for the oligopoly, even if costs conditions change. This is evident on how prices for online streaming plans are similar and these firms tend to follow price changes of their rival firms.
Development 2: Explain how the market structure (high barriers to entry and supernormal profit) would influence the way firms compete in terms of pricing and output decisions.
While oligopolistic firms like Netflix prefer to keep prices similar to other rival firms due to mutual interdependence, they may continue to compete in other ways to differentiate themselves from rival firms. With high barriers to entry to protect their supernormal profits, Netflix would have the ability to engage in research and development and conduct extensive competitive advertising to differentiate themselves from the rest.
For example, Netflix has been innovative in creating new features continuously on its application. Short video content type Netflix introduced a full-screen feed feature of hilarious teasers on mobile devices earlier in 2021 to feature short video content type

which is currently ruling on social media platforms like TikTok etc. Funny clips from new movies, series, sitcoms and stand-up acts were introduced so that users would be able to watch them immediately or save the suggestions on their watch list. These non-price strategies could enhance the product differentiation of Netflix’s online streaming services and increase the demand (and AR) through a favourable change in taste and preference for its services and reduce the degree of substitutability (XED value falls) and/or to make the demand more price inelastic (so that they can increase the price of their products without the fear of a drastic fall in quantity demanded).
Hence, the market share for Netflix may increase and there will be a greater ability for Netflix to set higher prices in future should demand be more price inelastic.
Conclusion:
Hence, the online streaming industry is considered as a competitive oligopoly based on its characteristics. This will determine the way they compete, in terms of pricing and output decisions, which then influence their performance.

"(b) Discuss the view that disruption by new technologies is more likely to be a threat, rather than an opportunity, to the existence of firms in an industry. [15]","Disruptive technologies could bring both beneficial and negative consequences to different firms (MPC vs Oligopolistic firms for example) based on the characteristics of their market structure and the strategies they use to overcome these impacts. Firms that faced a reduction in total profits and possibly earn subnormal profits because of disruptive technologies, may be more vulnerable to closures and hence these disruptions could more likely be a threat to their existence.
For firms to survive in the long run, a firm’s TR must be at least equal to TC. While operating its business in the SR, the firm’s TR must be at least equal or exceed its TVC for it not to shut down.
Body paragraph:
Thesis: Disruptive technologies is more likely to be a threat to the existence of some firms
1. Thesis 1: Disruptive technologies could cause a fall in AR which may threaten the existence of some firms
Disruptive technologies may reduce demand for goods and services from firms because there are opportunities for consumers to seek cheaper alternatives online (e.g digital financing vs traditional banking to access cheaper funds) or to self- manufacture (via 3D printing) or consumers booking online for their own flights instead of going through a travel agent. Hence, prices of goods and services from these alternatives due to disruptive technology are relatively cheaper. Demand will also be more price elastic because there are more substitutes that are available.
Diagrammatical analysis:
Disruptive technologies → fall in demand for goods and services assuming normal goods → reflected by a leftward shift of firm’s AR and MR curves to AR3 and MR3 respectively → assuming firms seek to profit max where MC=MR, the new eqm price and output will be at P3 and Q3 respectively. Firms will experience a fall in profits in the SR.

Assuming firms (oligopolistic & monopolistic competitive (MPC) firms) are currently making normal profits in the SR, the fall in AR & MR would result in firms making subnormal profits (C3efP3).
Link to question (existence → shut down condition): Firms will shut down in the short run if AR < AVC to minimise losses. But should AR > AVC, firms will continue production to minimise losses. Hence, the fall in AR may affect their ability to survive especially if they are only earning normal profits.
2. Thesis2:Disruptivetechnologiescouldthreatentheexistenceofsmall firms (like MPCs) due to the proportion of AFC relative to AVC.
The following reasons could explain how MPC firms could be more vulnerable to closure from disruptive technologies compared to oligopolistic firms (or firms with more market dominance).
1. Proportion of AFC relative to AVC
Perfectly competitive (PC) or MPC firms are more vulnerable to closures given the greater proportion of AVC relative to AFC. An MPC firm is more likely to face a greater proportion of AVC relative to its AFC. AFC is relatively higher for oligopolistic/monopolist firms due to the huge capital requirements needed to start production. This thus accounts for the relatively higher set-up costs.
Link to question (shut down condition in the short run): Thus, a slight fall in AR would imply that it is more difficult for firms facing high levels of competition to be able to cover their AVC. As such, they are more vulnerable to closure in the short run if there is a fall in demand due to disruptive technologies
Link to question (shut down condition in the lonf run): Meanwhile, in the long run, as there are no fixed costs, firms earning subnormal profits due to the fall in demand for their goods and services will have to shut down as AR< AC. PC or MC firms are more vulnerable to closure in the LR given that they can only earn normal profits due to the absence of BTE (or very low BTEs for MPC firms).

[Briefly explain LR equilibrium for
MPC firms] If existing MPC firms are
earning supernormal profits in the SR,
this attract new firms into the industry
due to the relatively lower barriers to
entry → they will compete away
customers from existing firms.
Therefore, each existing firm will now
have a smaller market share and hence
face a smaller demand for its product →
The demand (AR) curve of the firm will
shift leftward and become relatively
more price elastic due to the existence
of more substitutes. Supernormal profit is thus reduced → AR continues to fall and becomes relatively more price elastic until it is tangent to the LRAC curve and normal profit is made. When the firms in monopolistic competition make only normal profit, there is no incentive for new firms to enter the market. Long run equilibrium is attained. The firm produces output OQ1 & charges a price of OP1 which allows the firm to make only normal profits.
Link to the question: As firms in highly competitive industries make only normal profits in the LR, a fall in the firm’s AR & MR would imply that these firms are now earning subnormal profits and would have to shut down especially if the fall in demand due to disruptive technologies continue to persist in the LR.
EV: However, anti-competitive laws and high taxes may deter firms in less competitive markets from making large supernormal profits even if they are able to do so. Hence, in such instances, these firms may not necessarily have an advantage over other firms in highly competitive markets.
3. Thesis3:Disruptivetechnologiescouldthreatentheexistenceofsmall firms (like MPCs) due to the inability to invest in R & D.
In addition, an MPC/PC firm is more vulnerable to closure due to its inability to influence unit COP/ demand through investing in R&D/ advertising as it lacks the ability (as they only earn normal profits in the LR) to do so. As explained earlier, unlike an MC/PC firm, an oligopolistic firm is able to retain supernormal profits in the LR due to the presence of BTE. Due to lack of LR supernormal profits, an MPC firm does not have the resources to conduct R&D and extensive advertising to ↑demand to mitigate the ↓demand due to disruptive technologies→more vulnerable to closure which may threaten their survival [Link to the Q]
Anti-thesis: Disruptive technologies is more likely to be an opportunity to some firms

1. Anti-thesis 1: Disruptive technologies can be an opportunity for some firms to increase its profits due to the presence of high BTEs.
However, an oligopolist/monopolist is able to retain supernormal profits in the LR due to the presence of high BTE. As such, a fall in AR & MR would imply that these firms are now earning lesser profits. Even if these firms earn subnormal profits currently due to a fall in demand from the emergence of disruptive technologies, they are able to tap on past profits to help them cover the costs for the duration.
In addition, the past supernormal profits protected by high barriers to entry can be used by these firms to engage in R and D. Larger oligopolistic firms like Samsung can extract benefits from disruptive technologies and extensively engaged in R and D. For instance, Samsung has been leading the industry by introducing hardware (HW) and software (SW) that break the existing mold every year for the past 12 years since the unveiling of the first Galaxy S device in 2010. Some of the most game-changing so far include a large-screen smartphone with excellent immersion; a smartphone-stylus combination that enhanced productivity and creativity; and the world’s first dual-pixel camera technology. In addition, the Galaxy Note series, Galaxy tablet series and various wearable devices including Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Buds have contributed to the wider Galaxy ecosystem that has so transformed user’s lifestyles [examples].
This has boosted the demand for Samsung products (hence increasing their AR) over the years and enabled them to gain a greater market share where they have been thriving in profits while tapping on disruptive technologies.
EV: It depends on how these large firms could make use of their existing supernormal profits to engage in research and development as product and process innovation may not always be successful.
2. Anti-thesis 2: Disruptive technologies may benefit some first as there could be cost savings for these firms
Technological advancement can reduce costs of firm. Technology improvement has increases computer processing speed and storage capability eg cloud storage, allowing firm to manage larger amount of information at a much reduced costs. Improvements in communication made possible by the internet and devices like laptops and smart phones has streamline the communication processes firm has within and outside with suppliers and customers. The ability to tap on technology to mass produce has also allow firms to enjoy economies of scale. These can increase its efficiency in work processes and reduce units cost. In addition, technological advancement in the form of automation has reduced the need for labour in manufacturing process; significantly reducing costs for many manufacturing and logistic firms. The firm will see a downward shift of its AC and MC curves. The firm’s supply rise at each output level. Thus, technological

advancement can reduce costs for firms in many aspects for firms of different sizes and industries.
Link to the question: Hence, with a fall in costs, this might be an opportunity for the firms to earn greater profits, assuming that there is no change in AR. As explained earlier, firms will consider their variable costs in both SR and LR (where all costs are variable) to decide if they are able to survive.
EV: However, it depends heavily on how these firms utilizes the disruptive technologies to their advantage. Firms that are responsive to adopt these technologies may find increasing costs in the SR at first from the investment in technology but could experience long run unit cost savings from the greater scale of production. Conversely, firms that are more resistant to adopting technology may be faced with higher unit costs subsequently.
3. Anti-Thesis 3: Disruptive technologies may not be a threat to the existence of MPC firms compared to firms in less competitive industries because there are other factors affecting their survival.
One factor that influences the vulnerability of a firm to closure is the nature of the good sold:
• Firms selling normal goods where YED>0, during a recession where there is ↓income→↓demand→subnormal profit→more vulnerable to closure
• The magnitude of YED determines the threat to existence → the greater the magnitude → the greater the ↓demand → more likely to earn subnormal profit→greater degree of threat to existence
• However, for firms selling inferior goods where YED is negative, during times of recession→↓income→↑demand→↑supernormal profit→not impacted negatively by recession
• This is regardless of the level of competition faced by the firm, hence it is dependent on the state of the economy as well as the type of good that they sell.
• Hence, even in light of disruptive technologies, there are also other factors that could be a threat or an opportunity to the existence of different firms.
Conclusion
• [Address Question] The degree of competition, among other factors, plays an
important role in influencing profit levels and therefore a firm's vulnerability to closure due to disruptive technologies.
• [Evaluation - other strategies] Therefore in view of disruptive technologies, the existence of firms that are less likely to be threatened by it would be those that have made conscious effort to diversify the products that they sell, as they are

able to use the profits made from the sale of certain goods to offset losses incurred from some of the other goods that have falling demands. Government intervention may also aid in helping firms adapting to disruptive technologies and this could then reduce the threat to the firm’s existence. For instance, in Singapore, the government offers the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) to help local firms who are keen on adopting IT solutions and equipment to enhance their businesses.
• [Evaluation – theory of contestable markets] In reality, firms may not face actual competition but may still face potential competition. Thus, even if there were only a few firms facing little actual competition → they may only be able to earn normal profits for fear of potential entrants. Thus, it is also crucial to consider the degree of potential competition and not merely actual competition in the market. Hence, this might affect monopolies who could be more severely affected by disruptive technologies especially if they are not quick to adapt to new IT solutions and digitalisation.",,
"Theory suggests that resources can be allocated efficiently by the price mechanism, yet government intervention is evident across different markets.
(a) Explain how the price mechanism can allocate resources efficiently and why government intervention is advocated where factor immobility is present. [10]","Introduction
In a market economy, resources are allocated based on the price mechanism. However, the price mechanism works assuming the 2 conditions hold. Firstly, there is a perfectly competitive market, and secondly there are no externalities.

Development
1. Explain how the price mechanism works to allocate resources efficiently
The mkt is currently in equilibrium at point E1. Assume that the demand for coffee has ↑ given a change in taste & pref in favour of coffee to D2. Consumers signal ↑ dd for coffee by casting more dollar votes.
This will create a shortage of Q1Q3 at the original price, P1, which leads to an upward pressure on price. The ↑ in price signals to coffee producers to produce more as the upward pressure on price reflects higher profits per unit→qty ss ↑.
More resources will flow into the coffee industry. In the LR, the higher profits will also attract new firms into the industry → ↑ ss of coffee.
↑ price of coffee → csrs who are unwilling or unable to pay the higher price will be rationed out of the mkt→↓ qty dd for coffee
[Allocative Efficiency] Thus, in the LR, a mkt economy operating in competitive mkts will result in allocative efficiency, whereby the right amount of the right type of goods is produced & society’s welfare is maximised.
[Productive Efficiency] Moreover, in the mkt economy, producers are in competition with each other for the spending votes of csrs as csrs will buy from producers which offer the lowest price → thus producers are incentivized to produce at lowest cost if they are to survive in the mkt in the LR → thus in the LR, the mkt economy operating in competitive markets results in productive efficiency as firms uses least cost method of production.
2. Explain how factor immobility leads to market failure
However, factor immobility is one example of how distortions in the markets prevent the price mechanism from allocating resources efficiently, resulting in welfare loss.

Suppose there are changes in dd patterns from basic electrical items to sophisticated bio-medical gds as consumers become more aware of the health benefits.
◦ As labour is a derived dd:
◦ ↑dd for pharmaceutical workers (sunrise industry)
◦ ↓ dd for workers in the electronic industry (sunset industry)
◦ Due to occupational immobility, workers retrenched from the electronics industry are willing but unable to take up the jobs in the pharmaceutical industry due to the mismatch of skills.
◦ They will become structurally unemployed & would not be able to contribute to increasing production in the pharmaceutical industry.
◦ Allocative inefficiency: Labour immobility → underproduction of pharmaceutical gds due to an under-allocation of resources to the pharmaceutical industry → allocative inefficiency.
◦ Productive inefficiency: Due to the lack of skilled labour in the mkt for pharmaceutical gds→↑wages for skilled labour→↑ unit COP of pharmaceutical firms → prevents firms from using the least cost method of production → productive inefficiency.
Hence, labour immobility gives rise to both allocative and productive inefficiency & causes the market to fail.

Conclusion
Thus, due to factor immobility, the government will need to intervene to correct the market failure.",,
"Theory suggests that resources can be allocated efficiently by the price mechanism, yet government intervention is evident across different markets.
(b) Discuss the extent to which government intervention in different markets is likely to be successful in achieving the microeconomic objectives of a government. [15]","Introduction
The government intervenes in different markets in order to ensure an efficient allocation of resources. The government would also intervene to address the distributional problem of inequity. Inequity refers to an allocation of resources that is considered to be unfair.

Thesis: Govt intervention is successful in achieving the microeconomic objectives of a govt
1. Explain how govt intervenes in the case of factor immobility – to address inefficiency & inequity
Government may implement interventionist supply-side policy via providing or subsidizing education and training programmes.
Assuming workers are receptive, education & retraining will result in an increase in labour productivity & thus labour mobility as workers are more employable. This leads to a fall in supply of low-skilled workers as they leave the industry. As these workers move to the sunrise industries, this results in an increase in supply of high-skilled workers This thus reduces the problem of factor immobility.
◦ Allocative efficiency: Labour mobility → firms are able to produce the right amt of the right type of gds→allocative efficiency achieved.
◦ Productive efficiency: The increase in the ss of high-skilled workers→fall in wages for skilled labour→fall unit COP of firms in sunrise industries→ firms are able to use the least cost method of production→productive efficiency achieved.
Moreover, with improved labour mobility →reduces the wage differential & thus income inequality btw the low-skilled & high-skilled workers.
Possible EV: However, edn & training is a long-term and costly process to undertake with uncertain outcomes. The success of this measure depends on the receptivity of the workers which is highly unpredictable. If they are less receptive, ss of high skilled workers will ↑ to a smaller extent. As there is still a lack of high skilled workers, there is still an underproduction of pharmaceutical gds though to a smaller extent.
2. Explain how govt intervenes in the case of public goods to brg abt a more efficient allocation of res
Since it is not feasible & not technically possible to prevent non-payers from gaining access to the public good → weakens the incentive for csrs to offer to pay→no expression of dd→not possible to charge a mkt price for the gd.
Once the gd is provided→additional cost of providing the gd to another person is 0 → MC of providing the gd to one more person is 0→the efficient price to charge should be 0 (P=MC)→hence, no profit- motivated private firms would be willing to ss the gd if the price is zero.
However, public gds are essential services to the ecy & yield valuable benefits to society. Since the mkt mechanism fails to provide for such gds, there is a need for govt intervention in the provision of public goods.
[Link back to qn] Thus in the case of public gds → govt intervention WILL MOST LIKELY brg abt a more efficient allocation of res.

Anti-Thesis: Govt intervention is not successful in achieving the microeconomic objectives of a govt
1. Case where the price mechanism allocates resources efficiently
As explained above, as long as there are no externalities and the assumption of a perfectly competitive market holds, the price mechanism works in allocating resources efficiently. In such cases, any form of govt intervention will then brg abt an inefficient allocation of resources.
2. Explainhowgovtinterventioninthe case of taxation → may not achieve efficiency and equity
In the case of coal-generated energy, the govt may intervene due to the presence of negative externalities in production.
The burning of coal releases
MPC.
As the pte efficient output > socially optimal output→overproduction of energy →overallocation of resources in the mkt for coal-generated energy →resulting in a DWL.
The government could impose indirect tax, CF, that is equal to marginal external cost at the socially optimal level of output. Taxes cause the energy firms to internalise the external costs. This will increase the unit cost of producing coal- generated energy→MPC now coincides with MSC→new pte output is at socially optimal level, deadweight loss is now eliminated. The market is now allocative efficient.
Since energy is a necessity, demand for it tends to be relatively price inelastic which means that as price increases, quantity demanded falls less than proportionately. Hence, to reduce quantity of energy produced significantly, this would mean that a very large tax would be needed as opposed to if demand for energy was price elastic. This can worsen inequity issues as energy becomes less affordable to the lower income consumers.
Or
Moreover, the success in the use of taxes is limited by the accuracy in measuring the exact value of external costs which in practice is a difficult task as they may be difficult to monetise and estimate since externalities are “unpriced effects”. The govt may over-tax, and if the new DWL > original DWL → misallocation of resources

Conclusion
[Extent of mkt failure] Govt intervention will always brg abt a more efficient allocation of res in the case of missing mkts whereby the price mechanism fails to allocate any resources to the production of public gds given its characteristics.
However, on the other hand, government intervention will NOT ALWAYS bring abt a more efficient allocation of resources in the following cases:
1. Inthecaseofperfectlycompetitivemkt&noexternalities→Asthepricemechanism
would have able to allocate resources efficiently
2. If the extent of mkt failure is small, thus there is higher possibility of govt failure as
they may easily overestimate the mkt failure & over-intervene. This is more likely to occur in countries whereby the govt lacks the resources & infrastructure to ensure accuracy & reliability of data.
3. [depends on the type of govt intervention] In the cases of taxes, govt intervention will worsen the problem of equity as it brings about a rise in the price of g&s. likewise in the case of price ceiling, it brings about a permanent shortage in the market which could result in black market. In such cases, it will worsen the problem of equity as firms may offer a higher price to those who are willing and able to pay.",,
" In 2021, Singapore’s labour productivity grew by 5.2 per cent and its real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.6 per cent. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 2.3 per cent, unemployment was 2.7 per cent and trade balance was S$77 billion in surplus.

(a) Explain the link between labour productivity growth, cost of living and global competitiveness of a country. [10]","Introduction:
Define key terms:
• Labour productivity is defined as the efficiency of labour and measured by output per
man hour→influences COL and global competitiveness of a country.
• Cost of living refers to the level of prices relating to a range of daily necessities.
• Global competitiveness: consider the following aspects
→ increasing price competitiveness of a country’s exports,
→ increasing non-price competitiveness of country’s exports and → attracting investments such as foreign direct investments
Main Development:
Explain the possible link between labour productivity growth, cost of living and global competitiveness of a country:
• Higher labour productivity growth means that output per man hour worked is higher,
Ceteris paribus, this lowers unit labour cost of production (COP) and thus higher profit margin. This could increase the attractiveness of the country to investor and enhance SG’s global competitiveness. An increase in I will lead to an increase in AD from AD1 to AD2, ceteris paribus and increase in LRAS.
illustrate with AD-AS analysis (diagram and explanation) Increase in AD:

→ In the figure above, assuming the SG economy is operating the intermediate range of AS and the initial equilibrium is at E1 (where AD1 cuts AS1). The initial GPL and real output is at P1 and Y1 respectively. An increase in I, this could lead to an increase in AD causing total spending to exceed total output resulting in a shortage (Y1-Y3). This leads to a fall in inventories which provides an incentive for producers to increase output to meet demand. As there is limited spare resources, firms will have to bid up factor prices causing GPL to rise. There is a movement up along the AD & AS curve. The process continues until a new equilibrium is reached at E2 where AD2 = AS1.
→ Real output increases from Y1 to Y2 and GPL rises from P1 to P2 and thus a larger increase in a country’s cost of living assuming real income remains unchanged.
→ At the same time, demand-deficient unemployment decreases as production of output hence firms’ derived demand for labour increases which in turn increases ADL. With more people employed, it widens the tax base, and thus more tax revenue can be collected by the government. This increase in tax revenue collected can be used in providing education / training subsidies → further raise labour productivity growth

→ ↑ I → ↑ factor quantity / quality → economy is able to produce a higher level of output → increase in productive capacity of the economy → increase AS from AS1 to AS2→fall in GPL from P1 to P2→reduce inflationary pressure→fall in COL assuming real income remains unchanged
or:
• enhance global competitiveness via ss-side policies → increase I → enhance capital stock accumulation → enhance labour productivity growth → output per man hour worked is higher → lower unit COP, ceteris paribus → increase in profit margin → SRAS & LRAS rise and shift rightwards→fall in GPL→fall in COL assuming real income remains unchanged
or:
• enhance labour productivity growth via ss-side policies → skilled labour as a factor endowment→gain CA in the production of high valued-added manufacturing products (pharmaceuticals, automotive parts) → lower opportunity cost → lower unit COP, ceteris paribus→increase in profit margin→shift rightwards→fall in GPL
→ fall in COL assuming real income remains unchanged
→exports become more price competitive→SG’s global competitiveness is enhanced

"(b) Assess the sufficiency of the given data on GDP, inflation, and unemployment in comparing living standards between Singapore and other countries. [15]","Introduction:
Define key terms:
• Living standards or standard of living (SOL) refers to the level of material and non- material well-being of an individual. Material well-being is determined by the quantity of goods and services enjoyed by an individual and are affected by changes in availability of goods & services. Non-material well-being is the qualitative aspect of standard of living and includes changes in quality of life, as well as the changes in social factors and quality of the environment. Environmental factors are pollution, urban crowding, crime rates while socio-economic factors are life expectancy, infant mortality rates, availability of healthcare and amount of leisure.
• Data such as GDP, inflation and unemployment are known as key economic indicators used to assess the economic performance of a country.
Explain the model of framework:
• This essay aims to discuss the sufficiency and limitations of using economic performance data suggested in the signpost i.e., real GDP, inflation and unemployment rate in comparing SOL between Singapore and other countries.

Development 1:
Thesis: Explain how the statistics (real GDP, inflation and unemployment rate) can be used to compare SOL between SG and other countries (explain all 3 indicators)
The statistics given in the signpost can be used to compare material SOL of the Singapore economy with other countries in 2021.
(i) Real GDP:
• [define] Real GDP is the monetary value of final goods and services produced within
the geographic boundaries of a country over a year adjusted for price changes.
• [economic explanation] If Singapore’s real GDP growth rate of 7.6% is higher than the previous year, it implies that the economy is enjoying economic growth with increasing production, employment and rising income due to rising AD, assuming economy operates with excess capacity. Assuming that growth in real GDP is greater than growth in population size, this means that residents experience an increase in disposable income which increases their purchasing power, enabling them to
consume more goods and services. Hence, material welfare increases, ceteris paribus,
living standard increases.
• [link to question] A higher growth rate of real GDP in SG compared to another
economy means that residents in SG is likely to enjoy access to more goods and services relative to the other economy, thus increase in material SOL is higher in SG than the other economy.
• [EV] It is necessary to use real GDP per capita i.e., to consider the effect of changes in the size of the nation’s population. This is because an increase in GDP over time does not necessarily translate to higher standard of living in the country since the population size may have increased. Furthermore, for a more accurate comparison between countries, real GDP per head must be converted to a common currency such as US$ which is adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). If real GDP per capita measured at PPP in Singapore is two times that of Hong Kong, this will imply that twice as many goods and services are produced in the Singapore economy for each person than in HK leading to material well-being in Singapore to be two times that of Hong Kong.
(ii) Inflation:
• [define] Inflation is defined as a period of sustained increase in the general price level.
The inflation rate is the annual percentage change (rate of change) in CPI.
• [economic explanation] Singapore’s inflation rate in 2021 is 2.3%, indicating that general prices rose by 2.3% compared to 2020. Inflation rates reflect the cost of living for citizens in Singapore and hence determine their real purchasing power of goods and services. Real GDP can be calculated accurately only if there is information about
inflation rates hence it should also be taken into account in measuring material welfare.
• [link to question] Since Singapore has relatively lower inflation rate than US with an inflation rate of 4.2% in 2021, the real purchasing power of goods and services are higher in Singapore compared to US, thus leading to a higher material SOL in
Singapore.

• [EV] However, it is also important to consider the cause, magnitude and duration of the change in inflation rate in deciding whether a higher inflation rate will worsen the material well-being.
(iii) Unemployment rate:
• [define] Unemployment level (of labour) refers to the number of people in the working
age population who are actively looking for work but are without a job. Unemployment is usually measured by the unemployment rate, which is the percentage of unemployed persons to the labour force (comprises the total number employed and unemployed).
• [economic explanation] Low unemployment indicates resources are more fully employed; the economy is producing nearer to maximum productive capacity, which suggests there is a high material standard of living as output and income is high. A country aims to achieve low and stable unemployment of 2-3%. Given that Singapore’s unemployment rate is low at 2.7% in 2021, this suggests that material SOL is therefore high.
• [link to question] A lower unemployment rate in Singapore compared to other economies such as Brunei (one of the two smallest states in Southeast Asia) with an unemployment rate of 7.65% in 2021 would suggest a higher material well-being, ceteris paribus. With a greater proportion of the labour force being employed, it would mean that more individuals have higher income. Purchasing power would have risen and therefore the quantity of goods and services that an individual can enjoy would be higher. There are also other benefits such as lower crime rates leading to higher non-material standard of living.
• [EV] As unemployment rates can be computed in different ways such as claimant count and labour force surveys, such computations are not without inaccuracies due to illegal claiming of unemployment benefits, sampling error, etc. Thus, comparison between countries may be less meaningful if the countries use different methods of computing unemployment rate.
Development 2:
Anti-thesis 1: Explain the limitations of these statistics used to compare SOL between SG and other countries (choose 1 to explain)
The use of real GDP, inflation and unemployment rate may be limited in scope while comparing the changes in SOL to other countries due to the following reasons:
• Measurement Problem: Size of non-market economy differs
Goods and services which are produced but not traded or exchanged through barter trading (i.e., non-marketed goods and services) goes unrecorded. Workers who moonlight may not declare their income to avoid tax payments. For example, a teacher may receive payment for undertaking private tutoring in his spare time and not declare the income he receives to tax authorities. In this case then, some of the services that this tutor provides will not be included in the GDP data. As a result, the GDP for Singapore, hence SOL of Singapore residents may be understated by the extent of non-marketed activities and undeclared activities. The difference in the size of the hidden economy by different countries have different extent of accuracy in estimating

GDP data which makes any international comparison between countries inaccurate
and difficult.
• Usage Problem: Non-material welfare differs and cannot be measured by economic indicators as indicated by real GDP, inflation and unemployment rate, etc.
These statistics is an incomplete measure of the differences in standards of living between countries because it reflects only differences in material well-being and fails to consider differences in non-material well-being. For example, given Singapore’s fast pace of living, her residents’ non-material aspect of living could have been compromised due to their inadequate quantity of leisure. This aspect of standard of living cannot be reflected using only the above economic performance indicators as it considers only the material well-being of Singaporeans. If the real GDP per head of SG is 2 times that of Malaysia, but the residents of SG enjoy a lower level of non- material wellbeing due to urban crowding and high level of stress, then the SOL of SG residents is less than 2 times that of Malaysia. Economic indicators / data has overestimated the gap in SOL between the 2 countries.
[EV:] Even though a low unemployment rate suggests low stress levels, low crime rates, etc. and hence a high non-material SOL, it is not a holistic indicator of the non- material SOL of Singapore and other indicators (as explained above) are also required to compare SOL with other countries.
• Usage Problem: Income distribution differs
Although increases in real GDP per capita suggest improvements in material SOL, this may not be reflective of all residents due to unequal income distribution. If income gap has become relatively bigger, not all residents may experience a higher SOL. Hence the Gini coefficient should be taken into account when assessing the standard of living of a country and while comparing it with other countries. Countries with similar per capita incomes may still have very different standard of living for the majority of their population, if their distributions of income are not the same. For example, a country with a lower average income but a fairer income distribution actually enjoys higher overall standard of living, compared to another that has a higher income but with tremendous income disparity between the rich and the poor. For the latter country, it is because the small minority of the rich is so rich that their income is able to pull the average up and make the per capita income higher than other countries with more even distribution of income.
Anti-Thesis 2: Explain alternative measures that can be used to address the limitations highlighted in Anti-Thesis 1 (explain 1 alternative indicator)
One key weakness of economic indicators as a measure of standard of living across countries is non-material aspect of standard of living is not reflected.
Hence, need to examine a range of QoL indicators which include single dimension indicators (Gini coefficient, infant mortality, crime rates etc) and composite indicators such as Gross Progress Indicator (GPI), Human Development Index (HDI) and Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW).

[Explain HDI as composite indicator of SOL] The HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in three key dimensions of human development – a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and having a decent standard of living. HDI index is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best possible score and zero is lowest possible score. High values of HDI scores are associated with good health care systems, widely available education and a productive economy. The higher the HDI index (i.e., closer to 1) the higher will be the level of standard of living, in terms of both material and non- material aspect. This is because an increase in a country’s HDI value would have been attributed to an increase in life expectancy index, education index and/or GNI index (measured by real GDP per head (PPP$)). Countries like Kuwait and Singapore have lower HDI than real income per head. This suggests that GDP statistics over-estimate the SOL in countries like Kuwait and Singapore and hence a need to a holistic measure to SOL.
[EV:]
1. Generally, there is a positive correlation between income levels and HDI scores. However, the relationship is not always clear – cut. Some countries – low HDI scores despite relatively high-income levels e.g., Kuwait & Oman. Some countries – similar HDI scores but very different income levels (like Indonesia and South Africa).
2. Despite being more encompassing than real income per capita figures, critics have pointed out that HDI is still an incomplete measure of welfare because it does not take into account issues like political, social and economic freedom, human rights, protection against violence and discrimination and opportunities for creativity.
Synthesis and conclusion: [ Make judgement & take a stand] [Rank the three economic performance indicators in signpost]
Within the domain of material welfare, notwithstanding its limitations, real GDP is the best choice for measuring SOL of a country and real GDP per capita measured at purchasing power parity is the best choice for international comparison. This is because GDP statistics is one of the most commonly and accurately computed data. In addition, GDP data compared to other economic performance indicators such as inflation and employment, provides direct information about the purchasing power of the citizens and hence the quantity of goods and services citizens have access to can be determined.
[Compare GDP statistics and QoL indicators]
However, the given data is NOT sufficient to compare living standards between Singapore and other countries.
For instance, GDP statistics is not a perfect or infallible measure as it is only reflective of an average resident’s material welfare, does not take into consideration income distribution and ignore non-material welfare. The extent to which real GDP per head and real GDP per head (PPP$) is the best measure depends on the viewpoint of Singapore and different countries on the relative importance of non-material welfare and material welfare.

A more meaningful comparison of SOL can only be made if people in Singapore and other countries are able to make a qualitative assessment on how much they value quality of life. (People need to be able to value quality of life). The greater the emphasis given to non-material well-being by countries, the less accurate a quantitative indicator such as the real GDP per head or real GDP per head (PPP$) is. In this case, it is very important for GDP data to be used together with other quality of life indicators for a more holistic assessment.
However, composite indicators such as HDI, MEW, GPI which incorporate various factors that affect the quality of life hence providing a more complete picture of comparison of SOL between countries are commonly criticized for the less accurate and more subjective methodologies used.

"Rising global crude oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to an increase in import expenditure for India, the world’s third largest consumer of oil. While India’s exports have grown, there were fears of slowdown in advanced economies.
Adapted from: The Business Standard, 3 June 2022
(a) Explain how the above events will lead to a balance of trade deficit for India and why this might be a concern for the government. [10]","
Part (a) Introduction
[Define balance of trade] Balance of trade (BOT) refers to the difference between the value of exports and imports of goods.
[Explain the model of framework] Herein my essay, I will be examining the possible causes of trade deficit for India, which could possibly be due to rising import expenditure since oil prices have risen amidst the Russia-Ukraine conflict and slowdown in growth of export revenue.
Main Development 1 – causes of BOT deficit
1. OilpricesincreaseduetoRussia-Ukraineconflict
[Topic sentence] Due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, oil prices have increased which led to the increase in import expenditure. [Elaboration] The Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted global oil supply which led to rising oil prices ($139 a barrel, the highest level in 14 years). As mentioned in preamble, India is the 3rd largest oil consumer and because crude oil is an important input for generation of power and electricity, as well as for industrial/ manufacturing production, its demand tends to be price inelastic. Therefore, the increase in global oil prices will lead to less than proportionate decrease in quantity demanded for oil hence an increase in import expenditure. [Link to BOT] Assuming that export revenue remains unchanged, the increase in import expenditure will lead to BOT deficit, assuming that BOT is initially in equilibrium. OR
[Topic sentence] Due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, oil prices have increased which led to trade deficit. [Elaboration] The Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted global oil supply which led to rising oil prices ($139 a barrel, the highest level in 14 years). As mentioned in preamble, India is the 3rd largest oil consumer and because crude oil is an important input for generation of power and electricity, as well as for industrial/

manufacturing production, thus the increase in price of oil increases the unit cost of production. This reduces profit margin to producers and thus market supply falls. If sufficient market supply are impacted, there will be a fall in SRAS which results in a rise in GPL. Assuming that domestically produced goods are meant for exporting purposes, the increase in GPL would therefore reduce the export price competitiveness of India’s exports. Assuming PEDx>1 as there are many substitutes in the global market, there will be a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded for India’s exports, thus fall in export revenue, [Link to BOT] Assuming that BOT is initially in equilibrium, the fall in export revenue will lead to BOT deficit.
2. Slowdown in advanced economies
[Topic sentence] Due to the covid-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict, there were fears of a global economic shock which resulted in slowdown in most advanced economies such as United States. [Elaboration] As advanced economies experience economic slowdown, the real output increases at a decreasing rate which translated to a slower growth in income and hence slower growth in purchasing power. As such, there will be a slow growth in the demand for exports from India, assuming they are normal goods. This in turn leads to a smaller increase in export revenue for India. [Link to BOT] Assuming that import expenditure remains unchanged, the slow increase in export revenue will lead to BOT surplus, assuming that BOT is initially in equilibrium. [Link back to Qn] So, while export revenue may have increased slightly, import expenditure has increased significantly due to oil imports. If this trend were to persist, then India is likely to experience trade deficit where export revenue is less than import expenditure.
Main Development 2 – costs associated with rising BOT deficit (any 1 of the following)
1. Negative growth→lower material SOL
[Topic sentence] Increasing trade deficit may bring about costs to India economy such as negative growth and lower material SOL. [Elaboration] Given a trade deficit, there will be a fall in net exports and thus AD, ceteris paribus. Assuming that the India economy is operating with spare capacity, this will lead to surplus whereby total output is greater than total spending at original price level. This in turn leads to an increase in the firm’s inventories which incentivises producers to reduce production. Via the reverse multiplier effect, in which one’s spending equals to another’s income, there will be multiple decrease in production, output and national income. Real output decreases by dampened multiplier effect and thus results in negative growth. Assuming population size unchanged, there will be a fall in per capita income which suggests a fall in purchasing power and hence lower ability to consume goods and services thereby lower material SOL. [Link back to Qn] Therefore, rising trade deficit may bring about negative growth and lower material SOL

2. Rise in unemployment → lower material & non-material SOL
[Topic sentence] Increasing trade deficit may bring about costs to India economy such as increased unemployment and lower SOL. [Elaboration] Given a trade deficit leads to negative growth, there will be decreased in production of goods and services. As such, demand for factors of production will decrease. As labour is derived demand, there will be a fall in ADL. Assuming wages are sticky downwards, at the prevailing wage rate, there will be excess supply of labour which gives rise to increased demand- deficient unemployment, which in turn may bring about increased crime rates/social unrest, thus lowering the quality of life and hence, lower non-material SOL. In addition, with increased unemployment, it could possibly result in budget deficit since government would have to increase expenditure on unemployment benefits and the tax base has decreased thus tax revenue collected (both direct and indirect taxes) would have fallen. If budget deficit were to grow and persist, may become public debt which in turn will reduce India’s credit rating and thus reduce the investors’ confidence to invest in India. This impedes potential growth, hindering the achievement of sustained economic growth for India which lowers future SOL. [Link back to Qn] Therefore, rising trade deficit may bring about rise in demand-deficient unemployment and lower non-material SOL and in the longer-term, it may lead to lower future SOL.
3. Depreciation of rupee
[Topic sentence] Increasing trade deficit may bring about costs to India economy such as depreciation of rupee. [Elaboration] With increasing trade deficit in which export revenue falls short of import expenditure, this implies that the increase in supply of rupee is greater that the rise in demand for rupee in the foreign exchange market (FOREX). This would in turn cause a surplus at original price P1 which will exert a downward pressure on external value of rupee. [Link back to Qn] As such, rising trade deficit may lead to depreciation of rupee and should India government wish to intervene in the FOREX, it would lead to depletion of foreign reserves.
Conclusion
As increasing trade deficit brings costs to the economy, it is therefore necessary for India government to intervene with appropriate policies to mitigate the harmful impacts.

(b) Discuss whether the trade-off between macroeconomic objectives is the main factor in determining the choice of policies to achieve favourable balance of trade for any economy. [15],"Introduction
[State reason for government intervention] Government aims to achieve sustained economic growth, low inflation rate, low unemployment rate as their internal goals and a stable balance of payment as their external goal.
[Explain the model of framework] In pursuit of favourable balance of trade, there is a plethora of policies that governments may choose to implement such as expenditure- reducing, expenditure-switching or long-run supply side policy of R&D to reduce reliance on imported goods (oil). Herein my essay, I will be examining whether trade-off between macroeconomic objectives would is the main factor that determine the choice of policies for governments to achieve favourable balance of trade. Undeniably, the use of some policies may result in trade-off between macroeconomic objectives, but there could be other factors at play such as root cause of increasing trade deficit, time period in consideration or even severity/extent of the trade deficit.

Main Development 1 – Thesis: Trade-off between macroeconomic objectives is a factor in determining the choice of policies to achieve favourable balance of trade
1. Conflict between BOT and EG + Full Employment through the use of Expenditure-Reducing policy via CFP/CMP
[Topic Sentence] To reduce trade deficit so as to achieve favourable balance of trade, governments can implement expenditure-reducing policy.
[Step 1: Explain the aim of expenditure-reducing policy] Expenditure-reducing policies are aimed at reducing expenditure on imports via reducing the aggregate demand (AD) of the economy so as to reduce the level of national income and hence expenditure on imports. In other words, this method aims to deflate the economy thereby reducing consumers’ ability to buy foreign imports. When there is a fall in the level of imports, import expenditure will decrease and hence, this will lead to the improvement in balance of trade.
[Step 2: Elaborate how expenditure-reducing policy reduces trade deficit]
Expenditure-reducing policy via contractionary FP works by reducing G and increases taxes. The rise in personal income tax will lead to fall in disposable income of households, leading to fall in purchasing power. This in turn leads to fall in C. The raise in corporate tax will lead to lower after-tax profits for firms, discouraging investment, hence I will fall. With the fall in G, C and I, AD will fall, ceteris paribus. The fall in AD will lead to rise in inventories and this signals firms to reduce production. Firms retrench workers leading fall in output. This results in rising unemployment and falling income of households. As income falls, spending by households will fall. As one’s spending becomes another’s income, the fall in spending will lead to fall in income of another group of people because of the fall in demand for the goods and services the produce. The multiplier effect is triggered off leading to a multiple fall in national income. This contraction of the economy will result in the fall in households’ income levels and hence induce a corresponding fall in the demand for foreign goods (imports) and hence fall in import (M) expenditure. At the same time, a fall in AD also reduces the domestic inflation rate which improves the price competitiveness of the country’s exports. As a result, there will be a more than proportionate increase in quantity demanded of exports and export revenue rises assuming that demand for exports is price elastic since there are many close substitutes in the global market. Ceteris paribus, fall in import expenditure and a rise in export revenue will lead to an improvement in the balance of trade.
[Step 3: Elaborate how well expenditure-reducing policy works – focusses on conflict of macro goals (unintended consequences)] While expenditure-reducing

policy via contractionary fiscal policy or contractionary monetary policy may reduce trade deficit and achieve favourable BOT, it results in trade-off with full employment and sustained economic growth (elaborate any 1 unintended consequence).
▪ Impact on full employment: As AD decreases to reduce BOT deficit, this results in the contraction of real national output which will affect the demand for labour, since labour is a derived demand. As a result, aggregate demand for labour would fall. Assuming that wages are sticky downwards, at the prevailing wage rate, there will be excess supply of labour in which it gives rise to demand-deficient unemployment. [Link back to Qn] Since expenditure-reducing policy has resulted in trade-offs in terms of employment, government may instead turn to expenditure- switching policies/supply-side policies. Therefore, conflict in macroeconomic objectives is a factor that determines the choice of macroeconomic policy to reduce trade deficit to achieve favourable BOT.
▪ Impactonsustainedeconomicgrowth:AsADdecreasestoreduceBOTdeficit, if the government over-contracts the AD, then recession will ensue. The worst scenario will be ‘hard-landing’ where the economy transits suddenly from a period of expansion to recession. Furthermore, by raising direct taxes it will have long- term supply-side effects on incentives to work efforts and investment which may adversely impact LRAS and thus potential growth which in turn hinders achievement of sustained economic growth. [Link back to Qn] Since expenditure- reducing policy has resulted in trade-offs in terms of sustained economic growth, government may instead turn to expenditure-switching policies/supply-side policies. Therefore, conflict in macroeconomic objectives is a factor that determines the choice of macroeconomic policy to reduce trade deficit to achieve favourable BOT
Henceforth, because of the conflict of macroeconomic goals, government may look towards the use of other policies such as supply-side policies to reduce trade deficit.
OR
2. Conflict between BOT and Price Stability through the use of Expenditure- Switching policy via depreciation of exchange rate
[Topic Sentence] To reduce trade deficit so as to achieve favourable balance of trade, governments can implement expenditure-switching policy.
[Step 1: Explain the aim of expenditure-switching policy] Expenditure-switching policies are aimed at switching imports expenditure to domestically produced goods, and to switch foreign expenditures towards the purchase of the country’s exports. This is done by raising the price of imports relative to domestically produced goods and making exports relatively cheaper through the use of currency devaluation or depreciation, and protectionist measures (trade restriction measures).

[Step 2: Elaborate how expenditure-switching policy reduces trade deficit]
Expenditure-switching policy via devaluation of domestic currency (depreciation of exchange rate) makes the domestic country’s exports relatively cheaper in foreign currency, improving her export competitiveness. The fall in price of exports will cause foreigners to increase their demand for the country’s exports as long as price elasticity of demand for exports is more than zero (i.e. PEDx>0) leading to an increase in export revenue (X) measured in the domestic currency. At the same time, a devaluation of domestic currency will lead to a rise in price of imports in the domestic currency. With a rise in price of imports, quantity demanded of imports decreases. If PEDm >1, a rise in the price of imports brings about a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded and leads to a fall in import expenditure (M or Cm). Domestic consumers will also switch their consumption to domestically produced goods, increasing domestic consumption (Cd). Assuming Marshall-Lerner condition (PEDx + PEDm >1), a devaluation raises the export revenue and reduces the import expenditure. This reduces the BOT deficit, hence achieving a more favourable balance of trade.
Note: Students may elaborate in terms of imposing import tariffs (protectionism)
[Step 3: Elaborate how well expenditure-switching policy works – focusses on conflict of macro goals (unintended consequences)] While expenditure-switching policy via devaluation of domestic currency may reduce trade deficit and achieve favourable BOT, it results in trade-off with price stability. Devaluation will result in foreigners demanding more exports (X) and domestic residents demanding more domestically produced goods (Cd) as they switch away from imported goods (quantity demanded for imports falls). As such, AD will increase. Assuming that the economy is operating with limited spare capacity, the rise in AD will in turn increase the demand for FOPs as production increases to meet rising demand. This will lead to factor prices bidding upwards as there are limited idle resources available, bringing about demand-pull inflation over time. Therefore, conflict in macroeconomic objectives is a factor that determines the choice of macroeconomic policy to reduce trade deficit to achieve favourable BOT. Henceforth, because of the conflict of macroeconomic goals, government may look towards the use of other policies such as supply-side policies to reduce trade deficit.
Main Development 2 – Anti-Thesis: Other factors that determine the choice of policies to achieve favourable balance of trade (elaborate any 1)
Apart from the possible conflicts between macroeconomic aims, there are also other factors (constraints) that resulted in the choice of policies governments may decide to reduce trade deficit so as to achieve a more favourable BOT.
1. Root cause of trade deficit
[Topic sentence] In deciding the choice of macroeconomic policies to implement, governments are likely to consider the root cause of the problem. [Elaborate how root cause of trade deficit affect the choice of macroeconomic policies to

reduce trade deficit] For instance, in the case of India, her increasing trade deficit is likely to be due to the high import expenditure arising from her reliance on imported oil as mentioned in the preamble that she is the 3rd world largest consumer of imported oil, which makes India highly vulnerable to supply shocks. Therefore, to overcome the root cause of the trade deficit, India government should look at ways to reduce her reliance and thus imports on oil. This is possible by investing in R&D for cleaner and greener source of energy. Although the effects of R&D may be uncertain and may see effects on in the long run, the success of the R&D will not only reduce import expenditure but may also be an avenue for India to increase her export revenue. OR For instance, the fact that US has been suffering from a persistent and large trade deficit indicates a fundamental economic problem in the US and the country is continually living beyond its means. US could suffer from loss of comparative advantage to emerging economies as a result of increased globalisation and rapid modernisation of technology. Therefore, implementing expenditure-reducing or switching policies to correct the deficit may not be appropriate since it does not address the root cause of the problem. A better option for US is to restructure its economy by pursuing supply-side policies that increase the export competitiveness in the global economy. For instance, the US government can fund scientific R&D and establish comparative advantage in the exports of new fields such as green energy, nano-technology, bio-medical research in order to avoid competing head-on with China, so as to boost its export revenue. [Link back to Qn] As such, root cause of trade deficit is a factor that determines the choice of macroeconomic policy to reduce trade deficit to achieve favourable BOT.
2. Time lag of policies
[Topic sentence] In adopting macroeconomic policies, some policies may take a long time to take effect than others, so governments may have to choose the policies according to the urgency of the problem. [Elaborate how time lags of policies affect the choice of macroeconomic policies to reduce trade deficit] For instance, in reducing a BOT deficit, supply-side policies to increase productivity and boost export competitiveness may be adopted to increase export revenue. However, it takes time to raise the productivity of labour and capital. In the meantime, governments may adopt expenditure-switching policies via devaluation of domestic currency. This is because with a weaker currency, exports will become relatively cheaper in foreign currency while imports become relatively dearer in domestic currency. Assuming PEDx>0, there will be an increase in demand for domestic country’s exports and hence a rise in export revenue. At the same time, assuming that PEDm>1, there will be a more than proportionate decrease in quantity demanded for imports and hence a fall in import expenditure. The increase in net export revenue may reduce BOT deficit. This policy allows trade deficit to be reduced over a relatively shorter period of time, and may be adopted in the short-run to reduce a BOT deficit, while time is given for productivity in the export sectors to improve in the long-run. [Link back to Qn] As such, considering the time lag from the policies, expenditure-switching policy may be

favoured over supply-side policies. As such, time lags of policies is a factor that determines the choice of macroeconomic policy to reduce trade deficit to achieve favourable BOT.
3. Severity / Extent of the trade deficit
[Topic sentence] In deciding the choice of macroeconomic policies to implement, governments may consider the extent of the problem (i.e., large vs small trade deficit). [Elaborate how extent of the problem affect the choice of macroeconomic policies to reduce trade deficit] For instance, US has been suffering from a persistent and large trade deficit which may calls for more immediate actions to be taken to resolve the problem because the extent of negative impact arising from trade deficit could be dire. As such, US government may choose to implement expenditure- switching policies of erecting trade barriers or expenditure-reducing policy so as to reduce the size of the deficit in the immediate term, while devising supply-side policies in the meantime. [Link back to Qn] As such, considering the severity or the extent of trade deficit, expenditure-reducing or expenditure-switching policies may be favoured over supply-side policies. Thus, severity or the extent of trade deficit is a factor that determines the choice of macroeconomic policy to reduce trade deficit to achieve favourable BOT.
Synthesis & Evaluative conclusion – Judgement on whether trade-offs between macroeconomic objectives is the MOST important reason that underlies the policies undertaken to reduce trade deficit
As elaborated above, conflicts of macroeconomic goals may be one of the many reasons affecting the decision for governments to implement policies to achieve favourable BOT. Ultimately, whether trade-offs are the main reason for choice of policies depend on the state of economy, other appropriate policies in place to mitigate the harmful effects and the aim of government.
[E/Criterion] State of the economy
[E/Reasoning] Expenditure-reducing policy and expenditure-switching policy (protectionist measures) to reduce trade deficit may conflict with government’s aim of sustained economic growth and full employment. However, if the economy is facing high rate of economic growth and henceforth high inflation, the fall in AD via expenditure- reducing policy may actually bring about price stability instead. Moreover, expenditure- switching policy (depreciation of domestic exchange rate) and trade policy through signing more Free-Trade-Agreements (FTAs) to reduce trade deficit may conflict with government’s aim of price stability. However, if the economy is operating with excess spare capacity, expenditure-switching policy (depreciation of domestic exchange rate)

and trade policy through signing more Free-Trade-Agreements (FTAs) may not necessarily conflict with price stability.
[E/Opinion] As such, supply side policies to correct trade deficit to achieve a more favourable BOT is inevitably the better option for governments.
[E/Criterion] Other appropriate policies in place to mitigate the harmful effects
[E/Opinion] In reality, governments tend to implement a combination of policies to effectively tackle problems facing economy as there is no one perfect policy since every policy has its own limitations. [E/Reasoning] Expenditure-reducing policy to reduce trade deficit may conflict with government’s aim of sustained economic growth and full employment. However, if the government is also adopting trade policy to correct trade deficit by signing more FTAs to diversify the risk of contagion effect from trading partners, then perhaps this can help negate the trade-offs arising from expenditure-reducing policy. For instance, with the recent economic slowdowns and recessions in Western countries, countries like India may diversify and sign more FTAs focussing her trade with emerging economies which in turn may help to boost her export revenue and hence AD.
[E/Criterion] Aim of government
[E/Opinion] In my opinion, since governments tend to prioritise their macroeconomic aims in reality, trade-offs between the aims may not be the main reason for the choice of policies implemented to reduce trade deficit. Instead, it is the limitations and budget constraints that are of more importance underlying the choices of policies to reduce trade deficit. [E/Reasoning] This is because, in reality, governments usually will implement a combination of policies as it would be more likely to increase the success of achieving a particular aim instead. Furthermore, the assumption made is that governments prioritise all macroeconomic aims equally and strive to achieve all of them concurrently. Hence, when there are trade-offs, governments would adopt a combination of policies to achieve both aims. However, in reality, given the constraints faced (e.g. budget constraint), governments usually prioritise one aim over the other depending on the severity of the macroeconomic issues. For instance, for persistent and large trade deficit, the priority may be to implement expenditure-reducing policy so as to reduce trade deficit swiftly despite resulting in negative growth and demand-deficient unemployment. Despite these consequences arising from expenditure-reducing policy, governments may not adopt supply-side policies to increase productive capacity, if it is already facing a tight budget.

 (a) Explain the key drivers of globalisation. [10]","
Introduction
Globalisation as the process through which an increasingly free flow of goods and services, capital, labour and technology leads to the integration of economies and societies. It is brought about by improvements in information and communication technology lower transportation costs and economic liberalization, allowing countries to enhance their comparative advantage.
One of the key engines of globalization is the exploitation of comparative advantage which has led to rising volumes of world trade, rising volume of capital flows including short- term financial capital and foreign direct investments and also increases in labour mobility.
In recent years, comparative advantage that countries possess has been enhanced due to technological developments which have lowered transport costs and improvements in information and telecommunications.
Development
Devt (1): Globalisation has led to rising volume of world trade and one of the key drivers
is driven by the theory of comparative advantage.
The theory of comparative advantage states that even when a country has absolute advantage over another in production, both countries can gain from mutual trade if each country specialises in producing and exporting the good or service in which it has a comparative advantage i.e. can produce at lower opportunity cost. Extending from this, a country should export what it has CA in and import what it has comparative disadvantage in.
Different countries have different levels of factor endowments and thus are faced with different patterns of potential specialisation – differing opportunity costs in the production of goods. If each country specialises in the production of the good in which they enjoy comparative advantage in, total production of the good can be increased and each country will enjoy a higher level of living standards as trade makes it possible for a country to consume more goods and services; beyond its production possibility curve. The pursuit of such gains from free trade has led to the increasingly free flow of goods and services between countries.
Developing countries which tend to have a comparative advantage in labour-intensive industries like textiles tend to be exporters of such goods while developed countries which have a comparative advantage in technological industries tend to be exporters of goods like microchips and electronic products
Devt (2): Another driver of globalisation is the rise of the information economy due to advances in communication, transport and information technologies which bypass national boundaries.
With the rise of the information economy, new ideas move to market faster than ever before. There has been rapid development of computing equipment, including higher speed and lower prices. Adding to this is the development of high-speed transmission of information by relay stations, satellite and fiber optics. The result has been an explosion in the use of cellular phones and the Internet. This, combined with the rapid spread of computers to homes and offices, helped to create a service sector specialising in the provision and analysis of information. Supply chains also cross over oceans, letting firms buy whatever they want from whoever makes it most efficiently.
Also, technological innovation brings about the fall in transport cost over time. The development of containerisation and improvement in engineering technologies have facilitated the movement of goods, factors and people across countries. Globally, with the advent of air travel and entry of low-cost air carriers, this further stimulated the trend of rising flow of trade and capital across countries in different continents and thus enabling globalisation.
Devt (3): Another driver of globalisation is the opening of markets and higher level educational attainment leading to international mobility of labour.
As China, India, and the Eastern bloc countries have opened up, world markets and opportunities to export have expanded considerably for advanced economies and developing countries alike. This has created global surplus of workers in these markets waiting to be tapped on by trans-national corporations (TNCs). Hence this has resulted in growing investment flows to emerging countries and the set-up of export production facilities to the rest of the world. Together with relaxation of migration laws, greater flows of labour in the global economy.
Higher levels of educational attainment and labor productivity in emerging economies increased the mobility of labor competing for jobs in developed countries. This led to the migration of skilled labor from emerging to developed countries where labor shortages existed. The reduction in labour shortages will help to ease the high wages, lowering cost of production, enhancing comparative advantage of the country.

Devt (4): Another driver of globalisation is rising volume of capital flows which includes short term financial capital and FDI due to comparative advantage and fall in transportation costs.
Since the theory of comparative advantage determines the goods that a country should specialize in production and trade with other countries, it also governs the inflows of FDI into the country. Based on the factor endowments in the country, foreign direct investors will tap on the abundant factors that the country is endowed with and invest in the production of goods in which the country has a comparative advantage in. Hence, FDI inflows into a country would be in industries where the country has a comparative advantage. E.g. Singapore has been attracting FDI in industrial sectors in which it has comparative advantage in – high-end manufacturing and knowledge-intensive industries.
Advances in information and computer technology have reduced transport costs significantly across borders and are increasing the ease with which producers can coordinate production throughout the world. This increases the ability of producers to outsource and offshore production to other countries, to tap on the comparative advantage offered by foreign countries. Thus FDI inflows into these countries increase. Offshoring and outsourcing of production processes would lower cost of production and further enhance the comparative advantage of the industry in the domestic economy.
In addition, increased productivity due to improvement in information and technology enables MNCs to assemble products and parts of products not only in industralised countries but also in developing countries. Firms from DCs carry out FDI in the developing countries to take advantage of cheap labour while developing economies welcomed FDI as a convenient means to increase domestic employment and capital accumulation.
Note: Devt (4) has the same driver as Devt (1) & (2).
Conclusion:
The factors contributing to the trend towards globalization tend to reinforce each other. Trade liberalization implies that capital and labour become increasingly mobile.
In the world of growing integration, there are bound to be winners and losers. It must be acknowledged that the trend towards globalization has some negative aspects including a widening of income disparity between the rich and the poor within and across countries, exploitation of low skilled labor in developing countries by MNCs and environmental and natural resource degradation while under certain conditions this would lead to economic growth and higher standard of living.",,
"(b) Discuss whether a modest and gradual appreciation of its currency and the signing of free trade agreements would be effective for Singapore to benefit from globalisation. [15]
 ","Introduction:
Globalisation can bring about both benefits and costs to an economy. For a small economy like Singapore with small domestic demand, it is important to embrace globalisation to benefit from globalisation fully. The essay looks at the benefits of modest and gradual appreciation and signing of Free Trade Agreements in doing so.
Development #1 –Appreciation of Singapore dollar helps to achieve price stability allowing exports to remain price competitive
As Singapore is highly dependent on imports for both local consumption and for production of exports due to the lack of natural resources, the Singapore dollar cannot be too weak or strong. Therefore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) allows for a gradual and modest appreciation of the Singapore dollar, making its currency relatively more expensive against a basket of currencies in order to achieve price stability.
Appreciation of SGD can help to reduce imported inflation:
As Singapore imports a large amount of its necessities (food) and raw materials (oil which is necessary for all production processes), an appreciation of the Singapore dollar would cause the prices of imported goods and raw materials to be relatively cheaper in domestic currency. As such, it reduces the cost of production of goods and services that make use of imported factors of production, hence lowering the price that domestic consumers have to pay for final goods and services produced. Hence, firms in the economy are willing and able to increase production at every price level, causing a rightward shift of the AS curve from AS1 to AS2 as seen in Figure 3. GPL falls from P1 to P2, hence reducing cost-push inflation. At the same time, real output increases from Y1 to Y2.

Therefore, an appreciation of Singapore dollar would dampen cost-push inflation resulting from imported inflation.
Appreciation of SGD can help to reduce demand-pull inflation:
With a gradual and modest appreciation of the Singapore dollar, the domestically produced goods for exports become relatively more expensive in foreign currencies. As such, it loses its export price competitiveness in the international market. The demand for exports will fall since price of exports (in foreign currency falls), and assuming the price elasticity of demand for exports is positive (PEDx>0), this will result in a fall in total export revenue (in domestic currency) collected. With the fall in price of imports in domestic currency, assuming the demand for imports is price elastic (PEDm>1), there will be a more than proportionate increase in quantity demanded of imports, causing a rise in import expenditure.
Assuming that the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, where the sum of price elasticity of demand for exports and imports is greater than 1, an appreciation of Singapore dollar will then lead to a fall in the value of net exports. Thus, a stronger Singapore dollar can help to dampen the rise in AD in Singapore, hence easing demand-pull inflationary pressure due to excessive rise in external demand.
Establish link to how Singapore benefits from globalisation with lowered inflation.
With appreciation, inflation will be lowered. This will lead to a decrease in price of exports in terms of foreign currency and improve the competitiveness of exports. With the proliferation of E-commerce markets, lowered export prices can help to incentivise more foreign consumers from buying Sg-made products. This allow Singapore to benefit from globalisation by tapping on a bigger market size from overseas and not be limited by the domestic demand. This brings about higher increase in export revenue and aggregate demand. Actual growth is attained. It also improves the trade balance and balance of payments.

Low and stable rate of inflation also creates a more conducive environment for firms to invest. As household save more, the supply of loanable funds increases which reduces interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for firms to finance their investments. Low inflation also enhances the confidence of firms since they now have greater certainty over the expected returns of their investment. This will promote firms to take out long term investments which benefits Singapore’s potential growth. Since globalisation promote capital flows, this allow benefits of globalisation to be harnessed.
Address whether it would be effective for a small and open economy like Singapore
(+) The increase in net export revenue due to lowered inflation by appreciation enables Singapore tap on external demand and not to be limited by the small domestic demand. This allows them to achieve higher actual growth and standard of living. This is especially important for a country that is heavily reliant on trade.
(+) Since Singapore is heavily reliant on imported raw materials and finished products, appreciation will be effective to reduce imported inflation.
(-) Appreciation may bring about conflicts with other goals. Appeciation reduces net export revenue and worsen trade position assuming Marshall-Lerner condition (PEDx+PEDm)>1 holds. It dampens inflationary pressure if economy is near full employment, however, if the economy is below full employment it may cause negative growth. This lowers standard of living.
EV: [E- Criterion – Nature of Economy] Being a small country without any natural resources, Singapore is highly dependent on imported final goods and services as well as raw materials. Therefore, the problem of imported inflation is severe. [E- Opinion & Reasoning] There is a need to use appreciation to reduce inflationary pressure to harness the benefits of globalisation such that they can sell to a larger market. It is also unlikely that Singapore will experience negative growth due to appreciation because the economy is near full employment and even if it is below full employment, it can be complemented with alternative policies like expansionary fiscal policy. Hence it is likely that appreciation is effective.
Development #2 –Signing of FTAs allow countries to tap on larger market and greater investment opportunities.
Free Trade Agreements are binding agreements between 2 or more countries to reduce or remove trade barriers and facilitate cross border movement of goods and services between the territories of the parties.
With FTA, Singapore’s exports may be more price competitive in member countries and also gain access to larger markets. This is due to the removal of trade barrier like tariff that lower the price of exports.

Given that previously tariffs were placed on imports, resulting in price of Good X being P2 and quantity consumed at Q3. Upon opening up the market to free trade, domestic consumers are able to enjoy the lower world price of P1 and consume more quantities of Good X (from Q3 to Q4). Assuming Good X is an intermediate good meant for producing final goods and services, the lower price of P1 lowers the unit cost of production for firms that require Good X in their manufacturing process. This helps to increase supply and hence lowers prices of goods produced in Singapore. Therefore, price competitiveness increases.
With lowered price of exports, assuming demand is price elastic, there will be a more than proportionate increase in quantity demanded. This increases export revenue as exports become more competitive.
The larger access the market also allows firms to reap economies of scale. Firms may expand their production lines and get workers to specialize in a particular production stage. Workers thus become adept at their work and are able to produce more output per man-hour. This lowers unit cost of production and hence further making exports more competitive. Since producers can also sell to other countries freely, this increases the market size and further increase export revenue. The increased trade links with globalisation provide competition for domestic producers and enable greater efficiency of production and quality of the products. This further increase export competitiveness which in turn increase export revenue.
Signing of FTAs may attract foreign investments into Singapore, where foreign firms may be attracted to locate in Singapore to have access to the free trade markets. This is achieved by lowering barriers to entry for investors. Hence, this may help to further improve competitiveness when investments are targeted at technological changes to further increase productivity levels. Furthermore, such technology may also aid greater product innovations, where transfer of technology know-how may enable improvements to be made to the quality and design of Singapore exports, allowing Singapore firms to gain greater non-price competitiveness.

Establish link to how Singapore benefit from globalisation with larger access the markets and increased export competitiveness from FTA.
With FTA, the greater access to market enables lower prices of exports and increase export revenue. Both increase in export revenue and investment expenditure will promote actual growth. The specialisation of goods according to theory of comparative advantage allows greater gains in consumption and increase standard of living.
Similar to that of appreciation, Singapore will benefit from globalisation from FTA by tapping on a bigger market size from overseas and not be limited by the domestic demand. This brings about higher increase in export revenue and aggregate demand. Actual growth is attained. It also improves the trade balance and balance of payments. The inflow of FDI from stronger trade links allow faster economic growth for developing countries. Trade aids the transfer of skills and technology from the developed countries (DCs) to developing countries (LDCs), brings about better methods of production, better technology and leads to growth in productive capacity of the developing countries. The increased economic productivity due to more advanced shifts the AS curve rightwards and contribute to potential economic growth. As such, the economy can achieve sustained economic growth.
Address whether it would be effective for a small and open economy like Singapore
(+) FTA allows access to larger markets for Singapore who is heavily reliant on trade. FTAs may bring about cheaper raw materials for Singapore → fall in COP → AS increases → fall in imported inflation→offset the increase in prices due to demand pressure.
(-) Free trade increased dependency on external trade and trading partners, growth might be more volatile. For instance, if the trading partners suffer from recession, it will cause a fall in export revenue for Singapore.
(-) FTAs also result in ↓import tariffs → may lead to ↑import expenditure → assuming ↑import expenditure > ↑export revenue → may cause current account deficit if current account is initially in equilibrium
(-) The degree of technology transfer may be limited with FTA as the senior management of foreign MNCs tend to consist of their own foreign staff, rather than training locals to manage operations.
E(Criterion – Nature of Economy, Ability to overcome Negative impact): It is necessary for Singapore to sign FTA due to its small domestic demand. Her ability to overcome the negative impact will allow the benefits of globalisation to be harnessed. E (Opinion, Reasoning): To reduce the susceptibility of external shocks, Singapore will sign many free trade agreements with countries around the world so that they diversify their markets. To prevent the rise in import expenditure, the Singapore government can adopt supply side policies to ensure exports are competitive to improve its trade balance.

Overall Judgement
Both FTA and appreciation are effective policies for Singapore to benefit from globalisation in the short run. E(Criterion – Nature of the Economy, Root Cause of the Problem): This is because Singapore has a small domestic demand and is trade dependent. Appreciation enables goods to be priced competitively by reducing imported inflation and FTA enables greater access to markets they Singapore can sell to and attracts foreign direct investment. However, to fully harness the benefits of globalisation, there is a need to ensure that good quality of resources. E(Reasoning and Opinion): This is done by implementing supply side policies in the long run such as R&D to ensure that exports are competitive in terms of its quality and also education such that locals will be able to ride on the wave of globalisation to take on complicated jobs as structure of economy changes and not be structurally unemployed with greater rate of change of economy with trade. The supply side policies will re-position Singapore to be more ready to augment the positive effectis of globalisation.",,
